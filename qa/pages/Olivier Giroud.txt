'''Olivier Jonathan Giroud''' ({{IPA-fr|ɔlivje ʒɔnatɑ̃ ʒiʁu}}; born 30 September 1986) is a French professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]] for {{Italian football updater|Milan}} club [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]] and the [[France national football team|France national team]]. He is France's [[France national football team#Most goals|all-time highest goalscorer]].

Giroud began his senior club career playing for hometown club [[Grenoble Foot 38|Grenoble]], before he signed with [[Tours FC|Tours]] in 2008, aged 21. He was named [[2009–10 Ligue 2|Ligue 2]] [[Trophées UNFP du football#Player of the Year|Player of the Year]] in 2010 after finishing as the league's top goalscorer. He was subsequently the subject of a then-club record [[Transfer (association football)|association football transfer]] when he moved to [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]] in a transfer worth €2 million, winning the club's first [[Ligue 1]] title and finishing as league top goalscorer in [[2011–12 Ligue 1|2012]]. He then joined [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], where he won three [[FA Cup]]s to help end Arsenal's [[History of Arsenal F.C. (1966–present)#Trophy drought (2006–13)|nine-year trophy drought]], and is the club's [[List of Arsenal F.C. records and statistics#Goalscorers|eighteenth-highest all-time goalscorer]]. Giroud signed for crosstown [[Arsenal F.C.–Chelsea F.C. rivalry|rivals]] Chelsea in 2018 in a transfer worth £18 million (€20.7 million), winning the FA Cup, the [[2021 UEFA Champions League Final|UEFA Champions League]], and the [[UEFA Europa League]], finishing as top goalscorer in the latter in [[2018–19 UEFA Europa League|2019]]. Giroud then signed for AC Milan in 2021, helping them win the [[2021–22 Serie A]], which ended the club's 11-year league title drought.

Giroud made his senior international debut for France in 2011 at age 25, and has since earned over [[List of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps|120 caps]], including appearing in six major tournaments. He is his country's [[France national football team#Top goalscorers|all-time top goalscorer]], receiving the [[UEFA Euro 2016#Awards|Bronze Boot]] as joint second-highest goalscorer as France finished runner-up at [[UEFA Euro 2016]].

Giroud began organised football playing for his hometown club, Olympique Club de Froges. He spent six years training at the club before joining professional club [[Grenoble Foot 38|Grenoble]] at the age of 13.<ref name="giroud_career" />

==Club career==
===Grenoble===
Giroud spent five years developing in Grenoble's youth academy before signing his first professional contract at the age of 21. He later admitted that signing his first contract was an important part in his development as a player, stating "It took me signing my first professional contract to become aware of my abilities. If you [a club] trusted me, it was because I must have had some qualities."<ref name="giroud_lemonde">{{Cite news |date=30 October 2011 |title=Olivier Giroud, buteur né |language=fr |work=Le Monde |url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sport/article/2011/10/30/ligue-1-olivier-giroud-buteur-ne_1595293_3242.html |url-status=live |access-date=5 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120102050124/http://www.lemonde.fr/sport/article/2011/10/30/ligue-1-olivier-giroud-buteur-ne_1595293_3242.html |archive-date=2 January 2012}}</ref> Ahead of the [[2005–06 Ligue 2|2005–06 season]], he was promoted to the club's reserve team, which was playing in the [[Championnat de France Amateur 2]], the fifth level of [[Football in France|French football]]. Giroud quickly became an important player in the team scoring 15 goals in 15 matches.<ref name="giroud_lemonde" /> His performances over seven months with the reserve team resulted in the player being called up to the senior team in March 2006 by manager [[Thierry Goudet]]. Giroud made his professional debut on 27 March appearing as a late-match substitute in a 1–1 draw with [[FC Gueugnon|Gueugnon]] in [[Ligue 2]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=24 March 2006 |title=Gueugnon v.

Giroud was promoted to the senior team permanently for the [[2006–07 Ligue 2|2006–07]] season by new manager Payton Pouliquen and Nicola Malgeri and was assigned the number 22 shirt. After appearing as a substitute in the team's first league match of the campaign, he made his first professional start in a 2–1 defeat away to [[Chamois Niortais F.C.|Niort]] playing the entire match.<ref>{{Cite news |date=4 August 2006 |title=Niort v.

====Loan to Istres====

After a successful loan stint, Giroud returned to Grenoble with hopes of receiving some significant playing time as the club was now playing in [[Ligue 1]]. However, club manager [[Mehmed Baždarević]], who was hired while Giroud was on his loan stint at Istres, deemed the player surplus to requirements and, subsequently, listed him for transfer. According to reports, Baždarević had declared that Giroud "did not have the level to play among the elite".<ref name="giroud_lemonde" /> In 2011, Giroud reevaluated his departure from Grenoble stating "I am neither resentful nor vengeful. I am just disappointed with what happened to Grenoble when there was great potential".<ref name="giroud_lemonde" />

===Tours===
[[File:Olivier giroud.jpg|thumb|upright|Giroud playing for Tours in 2010]]

On 28 May 2008, it was reported that Giroud had agreed to a three-year deal with Ligue 2 club [[Tours FC|Tours]]. The striker was lured to the club by sporting director Max Marty who had previously served as the chief executive officer of Grenoble, Giroud's former club.<ref name="giroud_lemonde" /> Giroud was also fond of Tours' manager [[Daniel Sanchez (French footballer)|Daniel Sanchez]] stating "It's always a plus to have a former striker as a coach. His advice to me really helped a lot. With him, I progressed in my positioning and also in front of goal".<ref name="giroud_lemonde" /> Giroud was given the number 12 shirt and, due to injury, made his club debut on 3 September 2008 in a 2–1 defeat to [[US Boulogne|Boulogne]] in the [[2008–09 Coupe de la Ligue|Coupe de la Ligue]].<ref>{{Cite news |date=3 September 2008 |title=Tours v.

A hard-working striker, he is known in particular for his reliable goal scoring rate, size, physical strength, heading accuracy, powerful shot, ability to hold up the ball with his back to goal, and link-up play, or create space for his teammates with his movement off the ball.<ref name="giroud_dauphine">{{Cite news |date=8 November 2011 |title=Giroud, un avenir en bleu |language=fr |trans-title=Giroud, a future in blue |work=[[Le Dauphiné libéré|Le Dauphiné]] |url=http://www.ledauphine.com/actualite/2011/11/07/giroud-un-avenir-en-bleu |url-status=live |access-date=5 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328063343/http://www.ledauphine.com/actualite/2011/11/07/giroud-un-avenir-en-bleu |archive-date=28 March 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Mattias Karen |date=7 July 2016 |title=Arsenal should play with two up front to get best out of Olivier Giroud – Henry |url=http://www.espnfc.us/arsenal/story/2909082/arsenal-should-play-with-two-up-front-to-get-most-out-of-olivier-giroud-henry |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160710150839/http://www.espnfc.us/arsenal/story/2909082/arsenal-should-play-with-two-up-front-to-get-most-out-of-olivier-giroud-henry |archive-date=10 July 2016 |access-date=12 July 2016 |publisher=ESPN FC}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=Mark Brus |date=1 January 2017 |title=Arsenal have the perfect second striker in Olivier Giroud, says Jamie Carragher |url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/01/01/arsenal-have-the-perfect-second-striker-in-olivier-giroud-says-jamie-carragher-6355485/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170102124327/http://metro.co.uk/2017/01/01/arsenal-have-the-perfect-second-striker-in-olivier-giroud-says-jamie-carragher-6355485/ |archive-date=2 January 2017 |access-date=3 January 2017 |website=Metro |location=UK}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last=John Ashdown |date=15 February 2015 |title=Arsène Wenger hails Olivier Giroud as a wholly 'different player' |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/15/arsene-wenger-olivier-giroud |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171020034055/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/feb/15/arsene-wenger-olivier-giroud |archive-date=20 October 2017 |access-date=19 October 2017 |website=The Guardian}}</ref><ref name="mission">{{cite web |last=Stuart James |date=8 July 2018 |title=No goals?
