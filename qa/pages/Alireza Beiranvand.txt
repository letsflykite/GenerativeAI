In April 2014, he was called up to the [[Iran national football team]] training camp in [[South Africa]] by coach [[Carlos Queiroz]] after many [[Sepahan F.C.|Sepahan]] players could not make it because of [[AFC Champions League]] matches, including goalkeeper [[Rahman Ahmadi]]. He was also selected in Iran's 30-man provisional squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. However, Beiranvand was not included in Iran's squad for the World Cup, without playing any match in pre-World Cup friendly matches. He was called into Iran's [[2015 AFC Asian Cup]] squad on 30 December 2014 by [[Carlos Queiroz]].<ref name="2015acsquad">{{cite web|url=http://www.afcasiancup.com/news/en/nekounam-headlines-iranian-squad/10ppu97hz8lxf1ik1ux49b1ve0 |title=Queiroz Names Team Melli Squad |date=30 December 2014 |publisher=afcasiancup.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150101072926/http://www.afcasiancup.com/news/en/nekounam-headlines-iranian-squad/10ppu97hz8lxf1ik1ux49b1ve0 |archive-date=1 January 2015 }}</ref>
He made his debut in a friendly match against [[Iraq national football team|Iraq]] on 4 January 2015, just before the [[2015 AFC Asian Cup]].

During the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]], first-choice goalkeeper [[Alireza Haghighi]] was denied a visa for entry to [[Guam]] ahead of their fixture, alongside left back [[Ehsan Hajsafi]]. Beiranvand was thus given his first competitive start for the senior team. However, he was given a straight red in the 72nd minute for a foul on Guam midfielder [[Dylan Naputi]], less than a minute after Iran had used up all of their substitutions, forcing defender [[Ezzatollah Pourghaz]] to take on goalkeeper duties.

During the final round of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|2018 FIFA World Cup qualification]], Beiranvand became Iran's starting goalkeeper, replacing Alireza Haghighi. In May 2018, he was named in Iran's preliminary squad for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Russia]].<ref>{{cite web |title=World Cup 2018: All the confirmed squads for this summer's finals in Russia |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44083365 |website=BBC Sport |date=4 June 2018}}</ref>
