About his playing probability in [[Iran national under-23 football team]], Abedzadeh said:
"Again, they told me that they wanted to take the players who have been together for a long time and know each other well... They also explained that if we should qualify, they are going to call in and examine new players . So hopefully they can beat Iraq and qualify for [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|the Olympics]], and hopefully I'll get my chance then. I think the problem is that I was in England for the past four years and that they weren't able to watch me play as much as the local players. That has been pretty disappointing for me."<ref name="oursportscentral"/>

Abedzadeh was part of Iran's team for in [[2014 AFC U-22 Championship]], but he did not play any match. In 2015, he was invited to [[Iran national under-23 football team|Olympic team]] for [[2016 AFC U-23 Championship qualification]].
