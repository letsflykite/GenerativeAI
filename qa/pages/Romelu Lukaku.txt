===Influences===
In a 2016 interview with [[ESPN]], Lukaku named [[Didier Drogba]] and [[Nicolas Anelka]] as the two strikers who made him want to play for Chelsea, but it was the mention of a third striker during the interview, his idol [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]], that lit him up with excitement, with Lukaku stating,

{{blockquote|"Ronaldo changed football. He was the one you would look at. You would see him doing [[Step over|step-overs]] and you were thinking: 'Who does this?'

He scored goals where you were like: 'Oh man, this is not serious.'"|Lukaku speaking to ESPN on his idol, Ronaldo.<ref name="idol"/>}}

[[File:Kneeling for Black Lives Matter - Football.jpg|thumb|Lukaku, at the centre, with the [[Belgium national football team|Belgian national team]] in 2021]]

Lukaku has spoken out against [[racism]] he suffered while playing football, particularly the 2019–20 Serie A season, his first year playing in Italy.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Soccer Star's View of Racist Abuse|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/22/sports/soccer/romelu-lukaku-inter-italy-racism.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=10 September 2021}}</ref>

In 2020, Lukaku honoured [[George Floyd]] by kneeling and keeping one fist high in support of [[Black Lives Matter]] when he scored in a game with Inter against Sampdoria.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Lukaku scores as Inter return with win|language=en-GB|work=BBC Sport|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/51563514|access-date=10 September 2021}}</ref> This symbolic action was inspired by American football player [[Colin Kaepernick]] who kneeled during the [[The Star-Spangled Banner|national anthem]] before every game in 2016 as a peaceful manner of protest against police brutality towards people of colour. Since then, Lukaku and other players in Europe has taken an active role to [[taking the knee|take a knee]] on the pitches.
