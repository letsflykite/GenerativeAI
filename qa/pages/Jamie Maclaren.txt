'''Jamie Maclaren''' (born 29 July 1993) is an Australian professional [[Association football|soccer]] player who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]] for [[A-League]] club [[Melbourne City FC|Melbourne City]]. He has also previously played for [[SV Darmstadt 98|Darmstadt 98]], [[Perth Glory FC|Perth Glory]], [[Brisbane Roar FC|Brisbane Roar]] and [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]]. Maclaren initially represented Scotland at youth level, but has since appeared for [[Australia men's national soccer team|Australia]] at both youth and senior international level. He is a five time [[A-League Golden Boot]] winner as [[A-League]] top scorer in the [[2016–17 A-League|2016–17]] (19 goals), [[2019–20 A-League|2019–20]] (22 goals), [[2020–21 A-League|2020–21]] (25 goals) and [[2021–22 A-League Men|2021–22]] (15 goals) season, [[2022–23 A-League Men|2022–23]] and 24 goals). He is now the A-League all-time leading goalscorer overtaking Besart Berisha with 144.

==Club career==
===Early years===
Maclaren grew up in the north-western suburbs of [[Melbourne]]. He first joined the junior side of local team Sunbury United at the early age of four or five, then switched to the youth ranks of nearby Victorian Premier League (now [[National Premier Leagues Victoria]]) side [[Green Gully SC|Green Gully]] in 2003, where although he continued to play against older players, his team was very successful, at one point winning around 50 games in a row.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

===Blackburn Rovers===
In July 2009, aged 15, he was invited to trial for [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers']] under-16 squad. In his first trial match he scored two goals against [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]'s under-16 squad, followed by a [[hat-trick]] against [[Manchester United]], which resulted in a contract offer from Rovers.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.goalweekly.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1052:maclaren-raves-about-rovers&catid=42:football-focus&Itemid=66 |title=Young Victorian Signs for Blackburn Rovers |date=16 June 2010 |work=Goal Weekly }}{{Dead link|date=February 2023 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Maclaren benefited from the mentorship of fellow Australians [[Vince Grella]] and [[Brett Emerton]] at Blackburn, where he soon progressed to be a regular under-21 squad player and training with the senior team.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.blackburn.vitalfootball.co.uk/sitepage.asp?a=295076 |title=Getting to Know....Jamie Maclaren! |date=1 October 2012 |work=Vital Football |access-date=9 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160625074006/http://www.blackburn.vitalfootball.co.uk/sitepage.asp?a=295076 |archive-date=25 June 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> However, after four years in England having not broken into the first team, he was released by Rovers at the end of the 2012–13 season.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/10461885._/ |title=Blackburn Rovers confirm released list |date=4 June 2013 |work=Lancashire Telegraph |access-date=9 June 2015 |archive-date=27 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627230801/http://www.lancashiretelegraph.co.uk/sport/10461885._/ |url-status=live }}</ref>
