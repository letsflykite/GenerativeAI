'''Graham James Arnold''' (born 3 August 1963) is an Australian [[association football|soccer]] manager and former player. Arnold was appointed to work as a head coach of the Australian national soccer team in 2000. After head coach [[Frank Farina]] was sacked in 2005, Arnold worked with [[Guus Hiddink]] for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] campaign, in which they made the second round of the finals. After Hiddink left, he became interim coach of the [[Australia men's national soccer team|Socceroos]]. Arnold went on to qualify Australia's U23 men's national soccer team (nicknamed the Olyroos) for the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Arnold then went on to assist Pim Verbeek for qualification of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/default.aspx?s=insideffa_newsfeatures_newsitem&id=10206 |title=Coaches proud of team's achievements |date=27 June 2006 |publisher=[[Football Federation Australia]] |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060829111559/http://www.footballaustralia.com.au/default.aspx?s=insideffa_newsfeatures_newsitem&id=10206 |archive-date=29 August 2006}}</ref> Arnold went on to take the manager role at A-League club the [[Central Coast Mariners]] between 2010 and 2013, where he guided the club to a Premiership and a Championship. He is a member of the [[Football Federation Australia Football Hall of Fame]]. Arnold went on to win two Premierships, one Championship and an FFA Cup with Sydney FC. In August 2018, Arnold was appointed head coach of the Socceroos - Australia's senior men's national soccer team.

Arnold holds a number of A-League records: he has managed the second most games of any manager in the A-League (211), he has achieved the second most wins in the competition's history (116), he has the best career winning percentage of any A-League manager (54.9%), he has the best career unbeaten percentage of any A-League manager (81.5%), and he is one of just three managers to have won multiple A-League championships.<ref>{{cite web |last=Weiner|first=David |title=Graham Arnold gets Socceroos job after World Cup, with Asian Cup redemption his first task |url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/socceroos/graham-arnold-gets-socceroos-job-after-world-cup-with-asian-cup-redemption-his-first-task/news-story/e87382520916e27aff52cd67c355162e|website=Fox Sports Australia|publisher=News Corp|access-date=9 March 2018|date=8 March 2018}}</ref> In 2018 he replaced [[Bert van Marwijk]] as Australian coach after the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].<ref name="back to NT">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2018/m=3/news=arnold-named-van-marwijk-s-eventual-successor.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308090558/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2018/m=3/news=arnold-named-van-marwijk-s-eventual-successor.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 March 2018 |title=Arnold named Van Marwijk's eventual successor|work=FIFA.com|date=8 March 2018|access-date=11 June 2018}}</ref>

==Playing career==

===Club===
Arnold was a striker who started his career at Gwawley Bay in 1969. He played for them and Sutherland representative teams concurrently until 1979 when he moved to Canterbury-Marrickville in the [[New South Wales Premier League]]. He then moved to [[Sydney Croatia]] in Australia's now defunct [[National Soccer League]], where he was both the league's top goal scorer and player of the year in 1986. This was followed by a move overseas, where he made a name for himself in the Netherlands, playing for [[Roda JC Kerkrade]] and [[NAC Breda]]. He also spent time in Belgium with [[R.F.C. de Liège]] and [[R. Charleroi S.C.]] He went on to play for [[Sanfrecce Hiroshima]] in Japan towards the end of his career, before finally returning home to play for the [[Northern Spirit FC]].

===International===
Graham Arnold has represented Australia's senior national team 56 times in 'A' international matches, scoring 19 goals (85 caps, 33 goals including unofficial matches and 'B' internationals). He was given his full debut by [[Frank Arok]] in a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] Qualifier against [[Taiwan]] at [[Adelaide]]'s [[Hindmarsh Stadium]] on 23 October 1985. He scored on his debut as the "[[Socceroos]]" went on to record a 7–0 victory. His international playing career came to a sad end on 29 November 1997 in a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] Qualifier against [[Iran]] at the [[MCG]] when the score ended 2–2 and Australia was eliminated on the [[away goals rule]] after leading 2–0.

==Managerial career==
Arnold had a cameo role as a coach very early on in his career. He was coach for 2 games while he was a player at [[Sydney Croatia]] during the 1989/90 season. However, his proper coaching career started in 1998, when he was appointed player/manager of the [[Northern Spirit FC]]. He was the coach for 2 seasons, making the playoffs in their debut season.

===Australia===
[[File:Asian Cup Australia-Oman II.jpg|thumb|right|292px|Arnold (right) in 2007]]
He was then appointed to the position of Australian assistant coach in 2000, becoming interim coach in July 2006.

On 6 September 2006 Australia was defeated 2–0 in an [[Asian Cup]] qualifying game against lowly-ranked [[Kuwait]]. The [[Football Federation Australia|FFA]] confirmed Arnold would remain Head Coach through to the end of 2007 Asian Cup campaign.

Australia started their Asian Cup campaign drawing with [[Oman]] in its opening Group stage game in Bangkok. Media pressure focused on Arnold and on 13 July 2007 Australia were beaten 3–1 by the eventual winners [[Iraq national football team|Iraq]] in the [[2007 Asian Cup]]. Australia went on to be beaten by Japan in penalty shootout in the Quarter Finals. Arnold then continued in the role as Manager of the Australian U-23 side, qualifying through to the 2008 Olympics.

He was also linked with the manager's position at [[Bolton Wanderers]] and [[Norwich City]] in England but lost out to [[Gary Megson]] and [[Glenn Roeder]] respectively. With the appointment of Dutchman [[Pim Verbeek]] as the Australian manager, Arnold along with [[Henk Duut]] served as his assistant to the national side during the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa.

===Central Coast Mariners===
On 9 February 2010, it was announced that Arnold will take on the position of head coach for the [[Central Coast Mariners]] until the end of the 2012–2013 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ccmariners.com.au/default.aspx?s%3Dnewsdisplay%26id%3D32473 |title=News Display |access-date=5 November 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228205653/http://www.ccmariners.com.au/default.aspx?s=newsdisplay&id=32473 |archive-date=28 February 2011}}</ref><ref>[http://www.theroar.com.au/2010/02/19/graham-arnold-deserves-to-be-given-a-chance/ Graham Arnold deserves to be given a chance], The Roar, Retrieved on 19 February 2010.</ref><ref>{{Cite news |date=2010-02-09 |title=Arnold to take over Mariners |language=en-AU |work=ABC News |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2010-02-09/arnold-to-take-over-mariners/325432 |access-date=2022-12-14}}</ref> Arnold is recognised as one of the A-League's greatest ever managers, in part due to his contribution to the [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners Football Club]] between 2010 and 2013. At the conclusion of the 2011–12 A-League season he rejected a lucrative contract from [[Sydney FC]] and decided to stay on with the Mariners signing a one-year extension to his original contract with the club.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Arnie: I'll be Back - Australia News - Australian FourFourTwo - the Ultimate Football Website |url=http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/239042,arnie-ill-be-back.aspx |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120707220851/http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/239042,arnie-ill-be-back.aspx |archive-date=7 July 2012 |access-date=7 May 2012}}</ref> In his three full seasons with the Mariners, Arnold guided the club to two [[A-League Men|A-League]] Grand Finals ([[2013 A-League Grand Final|winning one]]), as well as the 2011–12 A-League Premiership.

In 2013, Arnold guided the Mariners to the knockout phase of Asia's premier club competition, in part thanks to a stunning [[2013 AFC Champions League group stage#Group H|1–0]] win away to [[Suwon Samsung Bluewings|Suwon Bluewings]] in Suwon, Korea Republic just 48 hours after their 2013 A-League Grand Final victory in Sydney, Australia.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Two wins in two days for Mariners |url=https://www.ftbl.com.au/news/two-wins-in-two-days-for-mariners-340900 |access-date=2022-12-14 |website=FTBL}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Habashy |first=Angela |date=2013-04-22 |title=Mariners head to Korea feeling invincible |url=https://www.theage.com.au/sport/mariners-head-to-korea-feeling-invincible-20130422-2iakv.html |access-date=2022-12-14 |website=The Age |language=en}}</ref>

Arnold is also recognised for having developed many young Australian talents during his time with the Mariners. Australian internationals [[Tom Rogic]], [[Trent Sainsbury]], [[Mathew Ryan]], [[Mitchell Duke]], [[Mustafa Amini]], [[Bernie Ibini-Isei|Bernie Ibini]], and [[Oliver Bozanic]] all developed their game under Arnold at the Mariners, and went on to enjoy great careers abroad.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gorman |first=Joe |date=13 November 2013 |title=Graham Arnold's move to Japan a natural progression |url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/14/graham-arnold-leaves-mariners-japan |access-date=14 December 2022 |website=the Guardian |language=}}</ref> Some of Arnold's tenure at the Central Coast Mariners is highlighted in the 2013 fly-on-the-wall sports documentary [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ewX4EdEdmk 'The Code: Life with the Mariners'].

===Vegalta Sendai===

In the month of November 2013 Graham was a target for a few clubs in Asia, especially [[Vegalta Sendai]] in Japan's [[J1 League]]. Although interest again raised from the Australian Football Federation to make Graham the national team coach, he always wanted to stay in club football over the national team setup and within weeks agreed terms with Sendai to be the first Australian coach to coach at the highest level in Japanese football.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-au/news/4021/a-league/2013/11/15/4407730/mariners-appoint-moss-as-arnold-joins-j-league?ICID=AR_RS_5|title=Mariners appoint Moss as Arnold joins J-League - Goal.com|website=www.goal.com}}</ref> Graham recruited his assistant from the Central Coast Mariners [[Andrew Clark (footballer)|Andrew Clark]] to join him in Japan. On 9 April 2014, it was announced by Vegalta Sendai that Arnold had mutually terminated his contract after an winless 6-game streak endured by Sendai.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-au/news/4024/aussies-abroad/2014/04/09/4740539/was-graham-arnold-doomed-from-the-start-at-vegalta-sendai|title=Was Graham Arnold doomed from the start at Vegalta Sendai? - Goal.com|website=www.goal.com}}</ref>

===Sydney FC===

====2014–2015 Season====
Arnold was appointed as the new head coach of [[Sydney FC]] on 8 May 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/08/sydney-fc-appoint-graham-arnold-new-coach|title=Sydney FC appoint Graham Arnold as new coach|first=Tom|last=Lutz|date=8 May 2014|website=The Guardian}}</ref> In his first season with the Sky Blues, they were runners-up in the [[2014–15 A-League]] season, finishing second behind Melbourne Victory, and losing the [[2015 A-League Grand Final]] to them.

====2015–2016 Season====
After the successful 2014–15 season, they saw an unsuccessful 2015–16 A-League season, finishing in 7th place and missing out on the Finals Series. He was, however, able to lead the team to a top place finish in Group H for their [[2016 AFC Champions League]] campaign. They were eventually knocked out by Chinese team [[Shandong Luneng Taishan F.C.|Shandong Luneng]] 3–3 on aggregate in the Round of 16.

====2016–2017 Season====
Arnold started his revamp of the squad by releasing 13 players in the pre-season. To solve the teams goalscoring issues, he bought in Brazilian striker [[Bobô (footballer, born 1985)|Bobô]] as their new marquee to play alongside former teammate [[Filip Hološko]] under the new 2 marquee rule. In addition to this, he also brought in 5 Australian players, including [[Bernie Ibini]] on loan, [[Socceroo]] [[Alex Wilkinson]] (two whom have worked with Arnold at the Central Coast) and [[Danny Vukovic]] from rival club [[Melbourne Victory]]. The season started off with a bang, with Sydney FC defeating their rivals Western Sydney Wanderers 4–0 in round 1. He led the team to a runners-up finish after being defeated 1–0 in the FFA Cup Final by Melbourne City.

Into the January transfer window, fan favourite [[Matthew Jurman]] joined K-League club [[Suwon Samsung Bluewings]], while keeper [[Vedran Janjetović]] swapped with [[Andrew Redmayne]] to cross city rivals, [[Western Sydney Wanderers]] after a dispute about not playing after being displaced by Vukovic. To replace Jurman, Dutch defender [[Jordy Buijs]] signed. The team was able to go on undefeated for 19 games in the league before eventually being defeated 1–0 in a controversial game against the Wanderers. This defeat only made the team stronger, as they went the remainder of the season undefeated, gaining 19 points out of a possible 21 for the remaining 7 games. His team was eventually crowned premiers after Melbourne Victory was unable to defeat Brisbane Roar, while Sydney had 4 games remaining. Arnold's 3rd season with Sydney proved fruitful, in addition to winning the premiership, the squad had broken multiple records, including the most points in a single season, breaking Brisbane Roar's 2010–11 season of 65 points in 3 fewer games with 66 points, as well as being the only top-flight football team in Australia to stay outright 1st throughout the whole season. Arnold was also named Coach of the Year at the Dolan Warren Gala Night. He ended the season with a 1–1 in the Grand Final, winning 4–2 on penalties against Melbourne Victory, becoming the first manager to win the championship with more than one club. Arnold went on to win the 2017-2018 Premiership, becoming the first coach in A League history to win back to back Premierships.

One of the highlights of Arnold's tenure at Sydney FC was his ability to recruit impactful foreign players to the club. Arnold signed the likes of [[Miloš Ninković|Milos Ninkovic]], [[Bobô (footballer, born 1985)|Bobo]], [[Filip Hološko|Filip Holosko]], [[Adrian Mierzejewski]], and [[Marc Janko]] to the Sky Blues, each of whom made telling contributions to Sydney's success between 2014 and 2018 alongside a raft of key Australian players including [[Brandon O'Neill]], [[Rhyan Grant]], [[Andrew Redmayne]], and [[Joshua Brillante]].

===Return to the Australian National Team===
[[File:Graham Arnold coaching Australia vs Syria, 15 January 20190 Asian Cup.jpg|thumb|Arnold managing Australia at [[2019 AFC Asian Cup]]]]
On 8 March 2018, after a vigorous search, it was announced that he would replace [[Bert van Marwijk]] as Australian coach after the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] following his notable success with [[A-League]] club [[Sydney FC]],<ref name="back to NT"/> as well as also taking charge of the [[Australia national under-23 soccer team|Olyroos]]. Almost immediately after Australia's uninspired performance at the tournament reached its climax, Arnold officially took the reins in the box seat of the national team. He opened his account strongly, with his team executing a comprehensive 4–0 win away to [[Kuwait national football team]]. In November 2018, Arnold's men were given their first genuine test of what was proclaimed by Australian media as the 'new era' of the Socceroos, drawing 1–1 against rivals South Korea in front of 32,922 fans at Brisbane's [[Lang Park]] in a friendly on 18 November 2018. On the day prior to the match, Arnold announced that [[Socceroos]] veteran [[Mark Milligan]] would be appointed captain for an indefinite period.

His first tournament on his second stint was the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup]], where Australia, as the defending champions, crashed out in the quarter-finals, where his team began with a shock 0–1 defeat to [[Jordan national football team|Jordan]] before ending the campaign with the same scoreline, this time to the [[United Arab Emirates national football team|hosts]] on the [[Hazza bin Zayed Stadium|same stadium]], thus suffered criticisms for the team's poor form in the tournament.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/jan/28/socceroos-asian-cup-campaign-a-disappointment-at-best|title=Socceroos' Asian Cup campaign a disappointment at best &#124; Stephen Ganavas|website=[[TheGuardian.com]]|date=28 January 2019}}</ref> Despite criticisms, he was able to guide the Olyroos to a third-place finish in [[2020 AFC U-23 Championship]], thus qualifying for the [[Football at the 2020 Summer Olympics|2020 Summer Olympics]] (delayed a year due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]]), as well as achieving for the first-time ever a straight eight wins in the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC second round|second round of 2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers]] to reach the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC third round|third round]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-26/olyroos-qualify-for-tokyo-2020-olympics/11901476|title=Olyroos set to make long-awaited return to Olympics after win over Uzbeks|newspaper=ABC News|date=25 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-06-16/socceroos-world-cup-qualifier-vs-jordan/100216162|title = Socceroos' streak continues with win over Jordan in World Cup qualifier|newspaper = ABC News|date = 15 June 2021}}</ref>

In June 2022, Arnold guided Australia to its fifth consecutive FIFA World Cup Finals appearance, leading the Socceroos to play-off wins over UAE on 7 June, and [[Peru national football team|Peru]] on 13 June in Doha, Qatar. In the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC–CONMEBOL play-off)|second play-off]] against Peru, Arnold made a key decision prior to the penalty shoot-out, substituting goalkeeper captain [[Mathew Ryan]] for [[Andrew Redmayne]]. Redmayne performed strongly in the shoot-out, saving a decisive penalty to help lift Australia to another World Cup; Arnold himself had been subjects of heavy criticism for Australia's under-performance at the third round of the 2022 FIFA World Cup qualification.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Australia vs. Peru - Football Match Summary - June 13, 2022 - ESPN |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/match/_/gameId/633780 |access-date=13 June 2022 |website=ESPN.com |language=en}}</ref><ref name=FIFAplus>https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/articles/socceroos-australia-graham-arnold-world-cup-qatar-2022-souttar-meulensteen-ryan-maradona-argentina {{bare URL inline|date=April 2023}}</ref> In the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], he led Australia to the round of 16 for the second time after 2006 when he was an assistant coach, following a 1–0 win over [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] in the last group stage match, making him the first Australian-born manager to achieve this feat, defying all odds and criticism aimed against him.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-11-30 |title=Mat Leckie strike stuns Denmark and sends Australia into World Cup last 16 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/01/australia-socceroos-denmark-world-cup-group-d-match-report |access-date=2022-11-30 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref><ref name=FIFAplus /> Australia were later eliminated by Argentina after a thrilling 2–1 defeat, despite the [[Australian national sports team nicknames|Socceroos]] putting up late scare to equalize.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Wagner |first=James |date=3 December 2022 |title=How Argentina Escaped Australia's Last-Ditch Rally to Advance to Quarterfinals |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/live/2022/12/03/sports/argentina-australia-world-cup-score |access-date=14 December 2022 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Waugh |first1=Chris |last2=Dominski |first2=Michael |date=3 December 2022 |title=Reaction to Argentina's win over Australia |url=https://theathletic.com/live-blogs/argentina-vs-australia-world-cup-2022-live-score-updates-result/sxDrFZ6iM2Cz/ |access-date=14 December 2022 |website=The Athletic |language=en}}</ref> Following the tournament, Arnold was named the best coach at the 2022 World Cup by French sports newspaper [[L'Équipe]] and had his contract extended to the [[2026 FIFA World Cup]], as he urged Australian officials to do more to promote football across the country.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-12-21 |title=Graham Arnold likely to sign new Socceroos deal after 'best coach' rating at 2022 World Cup |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/21/graham-arnold-set-to-sign-new-socceroos-deal-after-being-named-best-coach-at-2022-world-cup |access-date=2022-12-21 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-02-04/graham-arnold-says-socceroos-young-guns-can-only-improve/101931602 | title='We've got much more to give': Graham Arnold says Socceroos' young guns can only improve post World Cup | newspaper=ABC News | date=4 February 2023 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/socceroos/graham-arnold-reappointed-socceroos-coach-following-memorable-world-cup-campaign/news-story/ba3df58c73ec36dbde33c3190e4fe265 | title='Hunger has never been stronger': Arnie locked in as Socceroos boss until 2026 World Cup | date=30 January 2023 }}</ref>

'''Record'''
* Under Arnold, Australia (Socceroos) became [https://www.footballaustralia.com.au/news/watch-socceroos-v-oman-match-highlights first nation in FIFA World Cup qualifying history to win eleven (11) consecutive matches in a single qualification campaign] (September 2018 - October 2021)

==Olympic Games Association==
Graham Arnold has enjoyed a long association with the Olympic Games, having attended four Men's Football Tournament hailing back to Seoul 1988.

* At [[Football at the 1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul 1988]], Arnold was a member of Australia's squad under Frank Arok. Australia made the Quarter Finals, with Arnold playing in every match. 
* At [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|Athens 2004]], Arnold was Assistant Coach of the 'Olyroos' alongside Frank Farina. Australia made the Quarter Finals after performing strongly in Group C which contained Argentina, Serbia & Montenegro, and Tunisia. 
* At [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|Beijing 2008]], Arnold was the Head Coach of the 'Olyroos'. He mentored Australia's U23 men's national football team through a challenging qualification path in Asia, which included an away day in Pyongyang in North Korea where Australia recorded a vital 1-1 draw. At the Olympics proper, the Olyroos competed in Group A alongside Serbia, Ivory Coast, and eventual gold medal winners, Argentina. After drawing 1-1 with Serbia on matchday one, Australia lost late and by the narrowest of margins to a star-studded Argentina and Ivory Coast in its final group games. 
* At [[Football at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|Tokyo 2020]] (held in 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic), Arnold was the Head Coach of the 'Olyroos'. Australia hadn't qualified for the Olympic Games since Beijing 2008 (when Arnold was last in charge), however again Arnold guided Australia's U23 men's national football team through qualification in Asia. At Tokyo 2020 the Olyroos played their group games in Sapporo (two matches) and Miyagi (one match). The Olyroos pulled off [https://wwos.nine.com.au/olympics/australia-olyroos-beat-argentina-at-tokyo-olympic-games/cd71c00b-fa94-4c9d-9c14-582f4906173b one of the shocks of Olympic football history] in their first game, defeating Argentina - widely fancied to challenge for gold - 2-0. The Olyroos then narrowly lost to a star-studded Spain side on matchday two, before incurring a 2-0 defeat to Egypt on the third and final matchday. Arnold took charge of the Olyroos while he was mentoring the Socceroos in a bid to build more depth for Australia's senior national teams, and to help players develop their careers. Many of the young players that gained experience throughout the Olyroos' Tokyo 2020 qualification campaign and campaign proper have already graduated to the senior national team, and some, to bigger club stages abroad. These players include [[Denis Genreau]], [[Nathaniel Atkinson]], [[Joel King]], [[Connor Metcalfe]], and [[Marco Tilio]].
