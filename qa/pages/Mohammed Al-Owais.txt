On 30 January 2022, Al-Owais joined [[Al Hilal SFC|Al-Hilal]].<ref>{{cite web |title=اتفاق نهائي.. الهلال يشتري المدة المتبقية من عقد محمد العويس |url=https://akhbaar24.argaam.com/article/detail/586224|language=ar}}</ref>

==International career==

===2015-2016: FIFA World Cup 2018 qualifiers===
Al-Owais was called up to the senior Saudi Arabia squad for a [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] qualifier against [[Timor-Leste national football team|Timor-Leste]] in September 2015.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=275171/match=300317402/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150525030104/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=275171/match=300317402/index.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 May 2015|title=Saudi Arabia Timor Leste|publisher=fifa.com |date=3 September 2015 |access-date=14 July 2016}}</ref> He made his debut against [[Japan national football team|Japan]] in [[2018 FIFA World Cup Qualification]] on 15 November 2016.

===2018: FIFA World Cup 2018 performance===
In May 2018, he was named in Saudi Arabia's preliminary [[Saudi Arabia national football team|squad]] for the [[2018 World Cup]] in Russia. He originally served as the second choice behind regular [[Abdullah Al-Mayouf]]. However, Al-Mayouf performed horribly in the opener against [[Russia national football team|Russia]] as Saudi Arabia suffered a humiliating 5–0 defeat. This led to Al-Owais being promoted as the first choice keeper instead. Al-Owais played in Saudi Arabia's 1–0 loss to [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]], which he made some good saves even though it was not enough to save Saudi Arabia from elimination. This was Al-Owais' only game in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|title= World Cup 2018: All the confirmed squads for this summer's finals in Russia|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/440833652018}}</ref>

===2019: AFC Asian Cup 2019 performance===
Al-Owais was included in [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]]'s squad for the [[2019 AFC Asian Cup]] in the United Arab Emirates.<ref name="AFC">{{cite web |url=http://www.the-afc.com/afc/documents/PdfFiles/afc-asian-cup-uae-2019-complete-squad-lists |title=AFC Asian Cup UAE 2019 Complete Squad Lists |website=The-AFC.com |publisher=[[Asian Football Confederation]] |format=PDF |date=27 December 2018 |access-date=28 December 2018 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181228174458/http://www.the-afc.com/afc/documents/PdfFiles/afc-asian-cup-uae-2019-complete-squad-lists |archive-date=28 December 2018}}</ref> However, he produced a rather mediocre performance, only keeping clean sheet twice against weaker [[North Korea national football team|North Korea]] and [[Lebanon national football team|Lebanon]], as Saudi Arabia won both games. Against [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]] and [[Japan national football team|Japan]] though, his luck ran out, conceding three goals, especially against the latter as his side lost an important game in the round of sixteen and thus Saudi Arabia crashed out.

===2022: impressive FIFA World Cup 2022 performance===
On 22 November 2022, during a [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] match against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], Al-Owais was named [[player of the match]] for his goalkeeping performance, which contributed to a historic 2–1 upset victory for Saudi Arabia.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Adler |first=Nils |title=Saudi Arabia stun Argentina with inspired second-half performance |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/22/saudi-arabia-beat-argentina-with-inspired-second-half-performance |access-date=2022-11-22 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}</ref> Along with his teammates, Al-Owais was reportedly gifted a [[Rolls-Royce]] as a result of the team’s significant victory. However, he then conceded twice to [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and being the victim of [[Robert Lewandowski]]'s first World Cup goal, as Saudi Arabia succumbed to the Poles and thus lost the original advantage gained from the shock win against Argentina.

Later, Al-Owais also gained prominence for his acrobatic saves against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], which contributed to the elimination of Mexico from the group stage for the first time since [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978]]. However, Saudi Arabia still suffered a 2–1 defeat to the Mexicans in the end and as for the result, despite heroic efforts by Al-Owais, his team failed to progress from the group stage once again as Saudi Arabia stood bottom.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Agencies |first=The New Arab Staff & |date=2022-12-01 |title=Saudi Arabia coach: Al-Owais stopped bigger loss to Mexico |url=https://www.newarab.com/news/saudi-arabia-coach-al-owais-stopped-bigger-loss-mexico |access-date=2022-12-15 |website=www.newarab.com/ |language=en}}</ref>
