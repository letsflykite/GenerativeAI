In 2003, Alfaro led Quilmes to promotion. He stayed to manage the team for the following season ([[2003–04 Argentine Primera División|2003–04]]), achieving a 4th and a 6th-place finish which earned them qualification for the [[2005 Copa Libertadores]] and [[2004 Copa Sudamericana]] tournaments.

In his only shot at an important club, Alfaro had a disastrous spell in [[San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]], before joining [[Arsenal de Sarandí]] in late 2006.<ref>{{in lang|es}} [http://www.sportsya.com/futbol/ficha_jugador.php?id_jugador=3387&id_torneo=254 Sports Ya profile]{{Dead link|date=January 2020 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

Alfaro helped Arsenal to two 5th-place finishes, allowing the club to qualify for the Copa Libertadores for the first time in their history.

In that stage, they faced Brazilian team [[Goiás Esporte Clube|Goiás]]. Arsenal won 3–2 in Brazil and recorded a 1–1 draw in the second leg to win the tie 4–3 on aggregate, their official first victory over foreign opposition. Arsenal eventually reached the final of the competition, leaving a wake of sacked managers in their wake, including [[Daniel Passarella]], who resigned from [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] after their defeat by Arsenal in the semi-finals.

In the final of the competition, Arsenal drew 4–4 with Mexican [[Club América|América]], winning the title on the [[Away goals rule]]. This was the first major championship in the history of Arsenal de Sarandí and also Alfaro's first major title.

In the end of the [[2007–08 Argentine Primera División|2007–08]], season he was replaced by [[Daniel Garnero]] as manager of Arsenal. In October 2008, he was named as the manager of [[Rosario Central]]. At 2009 he went to Saudi Arabia to work in [[Al-Ahli (Jeddah)]], he came with high expectations from the fans. he stayed as the coach for 4 months, then on 20 November he resigned for personal reasons.

On 17 May 2010 Arsenal de Sarandí confirmed that the new manager for next season would be Alfaro, who arrived along with assistant coaches Sergio Chiarelli, Carlos González and Claudio Cristofanelli.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.celesteyrojo.com.ar/Pagina.php?pg=Informacion_07052010.html&img=ZN07052010.jpg |title=Gustavo Alfaro será el nuevo DT |access-date=17 May 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706080740/http://www.celesteyrojo.com.ar/Pagina.php?pg=Informacion_07052010.html&img=ZN07052010.jpg |archive-date=6 July 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> On 24 June 2012, Alfaro would achieve his first ever league title when Arsenal won its first league title in the club's history.

The Final Tournament of 2014 looked good for Alfaro. He had a very good team that was going to play at the [[Copa Libertadores]]. By April, the team was having awful results and he announced he would leave the club by the end of June. However, he was discharged by the club <ref>http://tn.com.ar/deportes/esencial/final-abrupto-arsenal-decidio-cortar-con-el-ciclo-de-gustavo-alfaro_492166 (In Spanish)</ref> and replaced by [[Martín Palermo]].

In the national competition he would finish third. On 2 May, he would be able to lift the 2018 Argentine Super Cup after playing against Rosario Central, winning in a penalty shootout by 6–5 after drawing 0–0 in the ninety minutes. On 2 June he would lose 0–2 against Club Tigre the final of the 2019 Super League Cup in Córdoba.
