After decades of hypothesising Australia's credentials to host the FIFA World Cup, the Howard Government welcomed tentative investigations into the viability of hosting the tournament as early as 2002. [[Football Australia]], known at the time as Soccer Australia, targeted bidding for the 2014 edition of the tournament.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Australia to bid for 2014 World Cup |url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/australia-to-bid-for-2014-world-cup-1.432093 |access-date=2022-09-18 |newspaper=The Irish Times |language=en |archive-date=20 September 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220920170919/https://www.irishtimes.com/news/australia-to-bid-for-2014-world-cup-1.432093 |url-status=live }}</ref> After realising that Brazil were overwhelmingly likely to receive the hosting rights - which they did in 2007 - [[Football Federation Australia]] focused on a formal bid for the 2018 FIFA World Cup, announcing their intention to do so in November 2007. After FIFA in December 2008 announced they would be accepting bids for both the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup, Australia registered their intention to bid with FIFA for the 2022 FIFA World Cup in February 2009.

The bid was officially launched on 14 June 2009 at Parliament House in Canberra.<ref name="launch">{{Cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/06/14/2597675.htm |title=Australia launches dual World Cup bid |accessdate=17 September 2009|work=ABC|date=14 June 2009 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091002063747/http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/06/14/2597675.htm| archivedate= 2 October 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref>

==Ground sharing issues==
Of the Australian stadiums that meet FIFA's seating criteria, none are primary [[association football]] venues. They are predominantly [[Cricket field|cricket]], [[Australian rules football]] and [[Rugby league playing field|rugby league]] playing [[List of sports venues in Australia|venues]]. At the proposed time of the World Cup during the northern hemisphere summer, these facilities are normally in regular season use by Australian rules football and the rugby codes. Former England international, [[Peter Withe]], now living in Australia, observed that "... there are some great stadiums in Australia but a lot of them are Aussie rules arenas. These are not great for the round ball."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/afl-fuming-over-soccer-world-cup-demands/story-e6frf7jo-1225807505412 |title=AFL fuming over soccer World Cup demands |accessdate=6 December 2009|work=Herald Sun}}</ref>

== Government support ==
Australia's bid has received government support from an early stage, with former-Prime Minister John Howard announcing federal and state/territory government support before FFA announced their intention to bid.<ref name="earlysupport">{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/soccer/world-cup-bid-for-2018-gets-political-clout/2006/07/14/1152637870779.html |title=World Cup bid for 2018 gets political clout |accessdate=3 January 2010 |work=The Age |location=Melbourne |date=15 July 2006 |first=Jessica |last=Halloran |archive-date=20 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090920225012/http://www.theage.com.au/news/soccer/world-cup-bid-for-2018-gets-political-clout/2006/07/14/1152637870779.html |url-status=live }}</ref>

Bid Chairman Frank Lowy AC announced at the bid launch that he has the personal commitment of the then-Australian Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, who announced the Federal Government's support for the bid in February 2008. In December 2008, Federal minister for sport Kate Ellis announced that the federal government would give Football Federation Australia $45.6&nbsp;million<ref name="funding">{{Cite web |url=http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/168438/ffa-receive-a45m-world-cup-bid |title=FFA receive A$45m for World Cup bid |accessdate=20 November 2009 |work=Sport Business |archive-date=4 September 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090904073254/http://www.sportbusiness.com/news/168438/ffa-receive-a45m-world-cup-bid |url-status=live }}</ref> to fund its World Cup bid preparation.

On 23 December 2009, with concerns over costs and effects of the bid upon other sporting codes, the Federal Government established a task force to take over much of the communication lacking by the bid in Australia. The taskforce will negotiate with governments regarding responsibility for stadium improvements, new facilities and financial guarantees. It will also organise and clarify ground-sharing arrangements with other sports and possible compensation for loss of venues.<ref name="taskforce">{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/sport/soccer/cup-bid-takeover-conveniently-buried-in-christmas-crush-20091226-lfs3.html |title=Cup bid takeover conveniently buried in Christmas crush |accessdate=27 December 2009|work=The Age | location=Melbourne | first=Dan | last=Silkstone |date=27 December 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100130065657/http://www.theage.com.au/sport/soccer/cup-bid-takeover-conveniently-buried-in-christmas-crush-20091226-lfs3.html| archivedate= 30 January 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref>

== Bid website ==
Australia's bid website was launched 14 June 2009 and contained bid information as well as being a social media platform where users could share content and connect with each other.

At the launch, FFA chairman Frank Lowy AC said the people of Australia were its "secret weapon" to snaring the 2018 or 2022 FIFA World Cup and encouraged the public to join the Association football-themed social networking web site. The public campaign was the first bid for a major event driven almost entirely by social media.<ref name="smdriver">{{Cite web |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/australians-asked-to-twitter-way-to-world-cup-bid-glory/story-0-1225734957493 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121231120454/http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/australians-asked-to-twitter-way-to-world-cup-bid-glory/story-0-1225734957493 |url-status=dead |archive-date=31 December 2012 |title=Australians asked to Twitter way to World Cup bid glory |accessdate=20 November 2009|work=The Australian }}</ref> Actress [[Nicole Kidman]], actor [[Hugh Jackman]], model [[Elle Macpherson]]<ref>{{cite news|url=http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/australia/news/1008881/Elle-joins-World-Cup-bid|title=Elle joins World Cup bid|publisher=[[Special Broadcasting Service]]|date=17 June 2010|access-date=17 June 2010|archive-date=20 June 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100620204722/http://theworldgame.sbs.com.au/australia/news/1008881/Elle-joins-World-Cup-bid|url-status=live}}</ref> and sports stars [[Ian Thorpe]] ([[Swimming (sport)|swimming]]), [[Liz Ellis]] ([[netball]]), [[Mark Webber (racing driver)|Mark Webber]] ([[Formula One]]) and [[Steve Waugh]] ([[cricket]])<ref>{{cite news|url=http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/168707,waugh-backs-oz-cup-bid.aspx|title=Waugh backs Oz Cup bid|date=13 June 2010|publisher=[[FourFourTwo (Australia)]]|access-date=17 June 2010|archive-date=29 September 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120929021110/http://au.fourfourtwo.com/news/168707,waugh-backs-oz-cup-bid.aspx|url-status=live}}</ref> joined to help promote the bid.
