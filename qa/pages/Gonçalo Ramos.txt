Ramos usually drops deep, to help his team build their attacking play by bring his teammates into play, and create chances for other players. Due to his awareness and willingness to follow instructions, he understands how to rotate positions in ways in which to benefit the ball-holder with his movement, short or long passes. When he is offering short, he aims to be positive in his control of the ball, he attempts to open his body up each time, with either foot, being able to hold up the ball and act as his team focal point in attack.<ref name=":Style of play1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.scoutedftbl.com/best-young-football-players/goncalo-ramos/|title=Profiling Benfica's Gonçalo Ramos}}</ref><ref name=":Style of play2">{{Cite web|url=https://totalfootballanalysis.com/article/goncalo-ramos-at-benfica-2022-23-scout-report-tactical-analysis-tactics|title = Gonçalo Ramos: The latest on the conveyor belt of talent|website=totalfootballanalysis.com|first=Christopher|last=Winter|access-date=6 December 2022}}</ref>

During his second season at Benfica, under [[Roger Schmidt (footballer)|Roger Schmidt]], Ramos has been deployed as a striker in a [[4–2–3–1]] formation. His ability to attack space and create further space both inside and outside the penalty area with his movement is what made the move to the centre a more natural progression. Ramos is good at picking up positions between the opposition's defenders and then exploiting space behind the defensive line. He presses with intent and is not afraid to put himself about against the opposition. Ramos usually links up with the midfield and makes proactive movements which always can put a striker in a goal-scoring position more often rather than standing around and waiting for the service, similar to [[Karim Benzema]].<ref name=":Style of play1"/><ref name=":Style of play2"/>

Ramos' father, Manuel Ramos, originally from [[Amareleja]], in Alentejo Region, is also a former Portugal youth international who represented [[S.C.
