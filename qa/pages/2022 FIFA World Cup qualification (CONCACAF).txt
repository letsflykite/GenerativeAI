The North, Central American and Caribbean section of the '''[[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification]]'''<ref>Also the "CONCACAF Qualifiers Road to Qatar".</ref> acted as the qualifiers for the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], to be held in Qatar, for national teams which are members of the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football ([[CONCACAF]]). Three direct slots and one inter-confederation play-off slot in the final tournament were available for CONCACAF teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2015/m=5/news=current-allocation-of-fifa-world-cuptm-confederation-slots-maintained-2610611.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530211217/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2015/m=5/news=current-allocation-of-fifa-world-cuptm-confederation-slots-maintained-2610611.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=30 May 2015|title=Current allocation of FIFA World Cup confederation slots maintained|work=FIFA.com|publisher=FIFA|date=30 May 2015}}</ref>

==Format==

===Original format===
On 10 July 2019, CONCACAF announced a restructured qualifying format for the World Cup.<ref>{{cite web |title=Concacaf Announces Format for the 2022 FIFA World Cup Confederation Qualifiers |url=https://www.concacaf.com/en/world-cup-qualifying-men/article/concacaf-announces-format-for-the-2022-fifa-world-cup-confederation-qualifiers |website=Concacaf |access-date=10 July 2019}}</ref> After CONCACAF initially announced in March 2018 that they would use the CONCACAF Ranking Index to determine the seeding of CONCACAF teams for qualifying to international tournaments,<ref>{{cite web |title=Concacaf Nations League |website=Concacaf |access-date=12 July 2019 |url = https://mailchi.mp/0af1ed6ff900/concacaf-nations-league-to-kickoff-in-september-with-qualifiers-featuring-34-national-teams}}</ref> it was determined that FIFA Rankings would be used instead.
*'''Top-seeded Hexagonal group''': The top 6 ranked CONCACAF teams based on the [[FIFA World Rankings|FIFA rankings]] of June 2020 were to play home-and-away round-robin matches in one single group (often referred to as the "[[Hexagonal (CONCACAF)|Hexagonal]]"). The top three teams would have qualified for the World Cup, and the fourth-placed team would have advanced to the CONCACAF play-off round.
*'''Lower-seeded group stage and knockout stage''': The remaining CONCACAF teams (ranked 7 to 35 based on the FIFA rankings of June 2020) were to be divided into eight groups (five groups of four teams and three groups of three teams) to play home-and-away [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] matches. The winners of each group would have advanced to a knockout stage, consisting of the quarter-finals, semi-finals and final to be played in a [[Two-legged tie|two-legged]] home-and-away series. The winner of the knockout stage would have also advanced to the CONCACAF play-off round.
*'''Play-off round''': The fourth-placed team of the Hexagonal group would have faced the winner of the knockout stage in order to advance to the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification (inter-confederation play-offs)|inter-confederation play-offs]].

However, on 25 June 2020, following FIFA's decision to postpone the September 2020 international window because of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], CONCACAF noted that "the challenges presented by postponements to the football calendar, and the incomplete FIFA rankings cycle in our confederation, means our current World Cup qualifying process has been compromised and will be changed."<ref>{{cite web |title=CONCACAF confirms 2022 World Cup qualifying will change |website=TSN |access-date=30 June 2020 |url = https://www.tsn.ca/concacaf-confirms-that-2022-world-cup-qualifying-is-to-change-but-no-details-yet-1.1489562 |agency=Canadian Press |date=25 June 2020}}</ref>

===New format===

*'''First round''': 30 CONCACAF teams, ranked 6 to 35 based on the [[FIFA World Rankings|FIFA rankings]] of July 2020, were drawn into six groups of five and played single [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] matches (two home and two away), with group winners qualifying for the second round.
*'''Second round''': Six first round group winners played in a [[Two-legged tie|two-legged]] home-and-away series. The three winners advanced to the third round.
*'''Third round''': Eight teams, three second round winners and top five CONCACAF teams based on those FIFA rankings, played home-and-away [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] matches in one single group. The top three teams qualified for the World Cup, and the fourth-placed team advanced to the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification (inter-confederation play-offs)|inter-confederation play-offs]].

==Entrants==
