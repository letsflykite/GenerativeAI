|quote="He has a future. I probably shouldn't say too much, but Ream has a chance to be a national team player. He's a center back who is comfortable and calm in possession of the ball. He plays a good passing game, he's an excellent passer. A European-type center back who, I think, reminds me of Rio Ferdinand in the Premier League. Ream is strong tactically and never stressed, and of course he's good in the air. He has a top-class attitude and spirit."
