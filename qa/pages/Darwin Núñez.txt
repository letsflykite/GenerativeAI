'''Darwin Gabriel Núñez Ribeiro''' ({{IPA-es|ˈdaɾwin ˈnuɲes}}; born 24 June 1999) is a Uruguayan professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and the [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay national team]].

Núñez came through [[Peñarol]]'s youth academy, being promoted to the first team in 2017. In August 2019, he joined Spanish [[Segunda División]] club [[UD Almería|Almería]] for a club record fee. [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] signed him in 2020 for a club-record transfer worth €24&nbsp;million, the most expensive signing in Portuguese football history. In his second season, he won the [[Bola de Prata (Portugal)|Bola de Prata]] for top scorer in the [[Primeira Liga]] with 26 goals in 28 games, being named in the Primeira Liga Team of the Year and [[LPFP Primeira Liga Player of the Year|Primeira Liga Player of the Year]]. Liverpool then signed him in June 2022 for a transfer worth €75&nbsp;million (£64&nbsp;million). In his first competitive game for the club, he scored as they achieved victory in the [[2022 FA Community Shield|FA Community Shield]].

After representing Uruguay at various youth levels, Núñez was called up to the full international team for the first time in October 2019. He scored on his international debut against [[Peru national football team|Peru]]. After missing the [[2021 Copa América]] due to an injury, Núñez represented Uruguay at the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]].

He often makes adjustments to his footwork to find space in the box and he also uses his body either to avoid a foul, but forcefully enough to arrive at a cross ahead of his marker.<ref name="Styleofplay"/><ref name="Styleofplay2"/><ref name="Styleofplay3">{{cite web |title=Player Analysis: Why exactly could Darwin Nunez be a generational talent? |url=https://thefootballfaithful.com/player-analysis-why-exactly-could-darwin-nunez-be-a-generational-talent/ |date=9 June 2022|access-date=18 June 2022}}</ref>

During his spell at Benfica, under [[Jorge Jesus]] and [[Nélson Veríssimo]], Núñez played in a variety of positions and systems. He played as a striker and a left inside-forward in a [[4–4–2]] and [[3–4–3]] formations, with the responsibilities in these roles, shifting on Benfica's ball possession or counter-attacking approaches for games. His ability to drift into the box and create space was a major part of his game, while also being aided by the presence of another striker (either [[Haris Seferovic]] or [[Gonçalo Ramos]]), which enabled Núñez to vacate his wide position to take up more positions in the penalty area.<ref name="Styleofplay3"/><ref name="Styleofplay"/><ref name="Styleofplay2"/> His playing style has led him to be compared to fellow Uruguyan forwards [[Diego Forlán]], [[Edinson Cavani]] and [[Luis Suárez]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Exclusive: Darwin Núñez's likely tactical shift and explaining 'poor touch' claims |url=https://www.empireofthekop.com/2022/06/16/exclusive-darwin-nunezs-likely-tactical-shift-and-explaining-poor-touch-claims/amp/ |date=9 June 2022|access-date=18 June 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title= ‘More to come’: Rio Ferdinand thinks Liverpool 23-year-old is brilliant and sends warning to Reds supporters |url= https://tbrfootball.com/rio-ferdinand-makes-darwin-nunez-and-diego-forlan-comparison/|access-date=20 June 2023}}</ref>
