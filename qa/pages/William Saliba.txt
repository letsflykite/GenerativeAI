==Club career==
===Saint-Étienne===
Saliba began playing football at the age of six, coached by the father of [[Kylian Mbappé]].<ref name="Saliba interview AFC">{{cite web |url=https://www.arsenal.com/william-saliba-premier-league-interview |title=Long read: Saliba on his lifelong love of Arsenal |last=James |first=Josh |date=8 October 2022 |publisher=Arsenal F.C. |access-date=9 October 2022 }}</ref> He eventually moved south to [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]] in 2016,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Faure |first1=Anthony |last2=Detout |first2=Arnaud |title=Ligue 1 : William Saliba, un Bondynois sur les traces de Mbappé |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/ligue-1-william-saliba-un-bondynois-sur-les-traces-de-mbappe-27-09-2018-7904148.php |access-date=13 January 2019 |newspaper=Le Parisien |date=27 September 2018 |language=fr}}</ref> and signed his first contract at age 17, in May 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.asse.fr/fr/actualites/william-saliba-passe-professionnel-ac22969|title=William Saliba passe professionnel|last=@ASSEofficiel}}</ref> Saliba then made his professional debut on 25 September 2018, featuring in a 3–2 [[Ligue 1]] win over [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/84679|title=Toulouse FC - AS Saint-Etienne (2-3) - Saison 2018/2019 - Ligue 1 Conforama|website=www.lfp.fr}}</ref> He made 13 starting appearances in his first season at Saint-Étienne.<ref name="arsenal"/>

After signing for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], Saliba returned to Saint-Étienne on loan for the 2019–20 season.<ref name="arsenal"/> He played 17 games for the club across the campaign, helping Saint-Étienne reach the [[2020 Coupe de France Final]]; he missed the match as the loan agreement ended two weeks prior to the final, which was [[Impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on association football|delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.worldfootball.net/schedule/fra-coupe-de-france-2019-2020-finale/0/|title=France » Coupe de France 2019/2020 » Final|website=worldfootball.net |access-date=4 March 2020}}</ref>

Although looking to temporarily extend his loan, had Saliba featured, Arsenal reportedly would have been due to pay Saint-Étienne €2.5 million.
