Jiménez began his career in [[Club América]]'s [[Club América Reserves|youth system]] before debuting in the [[Liga MX|first division]] in October 2011. He won his first championship with América in 2013, winning the [[2012–13 Liga MX season#Clausura|Clausura]] tournament, and was the team's second-highest goalscorer.

He amassed 120 appearances and scored 31 goals during his three years with the Portuguese side, winning two consecutive [[Primeira Liga|league]] titles, among other major honours. In June 2018, Jiménez joined Wolverhampton Wanderers on loan, and was the team's top-scorer with 17 goals across all competitions.
