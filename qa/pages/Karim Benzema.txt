Born in [[Lyon]] to Algerian parents, Benzema began his career with hometown club [[Olympique Lyonnais]] in 2005, contributing sporadically to three [[Ligue 1]] title wins. In [[2007–08 Ligue 1|2008]], he was named the league's [[Trophées UNFP du football#Player of the Year|Player of the Year]] and in the [[Trophées UNFP du football#2008|Team of the Year]] having finished as the league's [[Top goalscorers in Ligue 1|top goalscorer]] and winning his fourth league title and first [[Coupe de France]]. In 2009, Benzema was the subject of a then-French record [[most expensive association football transfer|football transfer]] when he joined Real Madrid in a deal worth €35 million. After struggling to establish himself in his debut season, he eventually achieved a consistent goalscoring rate with the club, notably being part of a highly rated trio alongside [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and [[Gareth Bale]] — dubbed ''BBC'' — who were integral to four Champions League wins from 2014 to 2018.

Following Ronaldo's departure in 2018, Benzema transitioned from the [[Forward (association football)#False 9|false 9]] position into a sole striker. He was named in the La Liga Team of the Season for four consecutive years from 2018 to 2022, won [[Trofeo Alfredo Di Stéfano|La Liga Best Player]] twice and the [[Pichichi Trophy]] for the first time in 2022. Benzema finished as Champions League [[2021–22 UEFA Champions League#Top scorers|top scorer]] as he won his [[2021–22 UEFA Champions League|fifth title]] in 2022, and subsequently [[Captain (association football)|captain]]ed the club in his final season before signing for Al-Ittihad the following year.

A [[France national football team|French international]], Benzema won the [[2004 UEFA European Under-17 Championship]] and made his senior debut for France in 2007, at age 19. He earned 97 caps, including scoring in three and appearing in four major tournaments, and ranks as France's sixth-highest [[List of leading goalscorers for the France national football team|all-time top goalscorer]]. Benzema was controversially left out of the squad for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] and did not play for France for over five years after being implicated in a blackmailing scandal in 2015; he later returned to the squad before announcing his international retirement in December 2022. He has been named [[French Player of the Year]] by [[France Football]] four times. For his performances in 2021 and 2022, Benzema was awarded the [[UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award|UEFA Player of the Year]] and the [[2022 Ballon d'Or|Ballon d'Or]], becoming the fifth French player to have won the Ballon d'Or.<ref>{{cite news |date=17 October 2022 |title=Karim Benzema sacré Ballon d'Or France Football 2022 |language=fr |work=L'Équipe |url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Karim-benzema-sacre-ballon-d-or-france-football-2022/1359907 |access-date=17 October 2022}}</ref> At 34 years and 302 days old, he is the second-oldest winner of the award, after [[Stanley Matthews]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Starling |first1=Mike |date=18 October 2022 |title=Karim Benzema's 'goal': Ballon d'Or, Champions League and a World Cup in one year? |url=https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/sport/football/958213/karim-benzema-goal-ballon-dor-champions-league-world-cup |access-date=18 October 2022 |website=The Week |language=English}}</ref>

Benzema began the [[2005–06 Ligue 1|2005–06 season]] under the tutelage of new manager [[Gérard Houllier]].

====2010 World Cup omission====

Following the World Cup, Benzema returned to the national team under the reign of new coach [[Laurent Blanc]]. Blanc, an admirer of Benzema, sought to build the attack around the striker and, after going almost a year without representing France, Benzema made his return to the team in its 2–1 defeat to [[Norway national football team|Norway]] in [[Oslo]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Laurent Blanc: Benzema is 'not used to working' |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=828433&sec=euro2012&cc=5901 |publisher=[[ESPN]] |date=30 September 2010 |access-date=6 May 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Norway sink France thanks to Huseklepp double |url=https://af.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idAFJOE67B04520100812 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814180404/http://af.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idAFJOE67B04520100812 |url-status=dead |archive-date=14 August 2010 |agency=[[Reuters]] |date=12 August 2010 |access-date=13 December 2011}}</ref> Alongside Gourcuff, Benzema led the team in scoring in [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group D|qualifying]] for [[UEFA Euro 2012]], netting three.

====2014 World Cup====
On 11 October 2013, Benzema scored his first goal for the France national team since June 2012 in a friendly against [[Australia national association football team|Australia]], thus ending a scoring drought for his national team which had lasted 1,222 minutes. In that match played at the [[Parc des Princes]] in [[Paris]], which France won 6–0, Benzema scored France's sixth and final goal in the 50th minute after turning home [[Franck Ribéry]]'s left-wing cross.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-us/match/124721/france-vs-australia/report?|title=France 6–0 Australia: Benzema breaks goal drought in friendly drubbing|date=11 October 2013|work=Goal (website) |access-date=22 November 2013|archive-date=21 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180721162529/http://www.goal.com/en-us/match/124721/france-vs-australia/report|url-status=dead}}</ref> In the second leg of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA second round|2014 World Cup qualification play-off]] against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] held on 19 November 2013 at the Stade de France, Benzema scored France's second goal in the 34th minute to level the aggregate score at 2–2. Benzema scored his goal when he side-footed home after a huge scramble in the Ukrainian penalty box, although he was shown on television replays to be offside by almost one metre when the ball took a final touch off [[Mathieu Valbuena]]'s chest. Benzema had four minutes earlier been denied a legitimate goal, the offside flag wrongly raised when he turned in Ribéry's low cross into the net with his torso a metre from the Ukrainian goal-line. Ukraine had won the first leg of the play-off 2–0 in [[Kyiv]] just four days earlier. France would eventually win the second leg 3–0 to advance to the 2014 World Cup finals in [[Brazil]] with a 3–2 aggregate scoreline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/304251/report|title=World Cup Qualifiers: France revival sinks Ukraine 3–0|date=20 November 2013|publisher=Sky Sports}}</ref>

An atypical [[Squad number (association football)|number 9]], although he is usually deployed as a [[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|centre forward]], and can operate as an out-and-out striker, Benzema is also capable of playing in several other offensive positions, and has been used on the [[Forward (association football)#Winger|wing]], or even as a [[playmaker]] behind the main striker, either in the number 10 role as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]], or as a deep-lying forward.

During his time at Madrid, Benzema has also been praised by pundits for his work-rate and tactical intelligence off the ball, as well as his positional sense and attacking movement as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]], which often draws opposing defenders out of position, and in turn creates spaces for his teammates; as such, he formed a strong offensive partnership with [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] during the latter's time with the club. Indeed, Benzema's movement drew defenders away and created space for Ronaldo to make attacking runs into the centre of the area from the left wing, which essentially saw the Frenchman act as a [[Forward (association football)#False 9|false 9]].{{#tag:ref|See<ref name="return"/><ref name="perfect"/><ref>{{cite web|first=Ian |last=Hawkey |date=28 February 2016 |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/players/cristiano-ronaldo/12177090/Cristiano-Ronaldo-takes-aim-at-Real-Madrid-teammates-as-La-Liga-hopes-take-mortal-blow.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220111/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/players/cristiano-ronaldo/12177090/Cristiano-Ronaldo-takes-aim-at-Real-Madrid-teammates-as-La-Liga-hopes-take-mortal-blow.html |archive-date=11 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |title=Cristiano Ronaldo takes aim at Real Madrid teammates as La Liga hopes take mortal blow |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |access-date=2 May 2016}}{{cbignore}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/why-benzema-too-important-leave-real-madrid-season#:rfHxSHexxqfR0A|title=Why Benzema is too important to leave Real Madrid this season |work=FourFourTwo |first=John |last=Robertson |date=28 August 2015 |access-date=2 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.squawka.com/news/karim-benzema-is-the-mvp-of-the-b-b-c/625032 |title=Karim Benzema is the real MVP of Real Madrid's star-studded attack |work=Squawka |first=Muhammad |last=Butt |date=21 March 2016 |access-date=4 January 2018 |archive-date=5 January 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180105070200/http://www.squawka.com/news/karim-benzema-is-the-mvp-of-the-b-b-c/625032 |url-status=dead }}</ref>|name="style2"|group="nb"}} Following Ronaldo's departure in 2018, he took on a new role as the club's main striker, playing with his back to goal less frequently, and instead receiving the ball facing the goal and taking more touches inside the penalty area; in this position, he also often drifted out wide onto the left flank, while he was able to utilise his control and touch on the ball effectively to create goalscoring opportunities for himself inside the box. The positional change saw an increase in his goalscoring output for the club and an improvement in his shooting, for which he had occasionally come under criticism from the press in the past, as demonstrated by the variety of his goals, his conversion rate, and his clinical finishing with his feet as well as his head; however, in addition to taking over the role of the team's main goalscorer, he also still continued to serve as link-up player for the team's front line by creating chances for his teammates.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/61069998 |title=How Benzema has become one of world's top strikers |work=BBC Sport |last=Chohan |first=Raj |date=12 April 2022 |access-date=3 June 2022 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/karim-benzema-cristiano-ronaldo-deputy-real-madrid/blt5df82668575c76ec |title=Benzema: I wasn't Ronaldo's deputy at Real Madrid |work=Goal (website) |last=Harraz |first=Marwan |date=15 January 2022 |access-date=3 June 2022 }}</ref>

Deschamps then claimed that Benzema made the decision to leave the France team himself, saying "when I woke up, I learned that he had left". However, Benzema responded on his Instagram story by reposting the Deschamps statement in the interview with the caption "but what audacity". He posted a further story of French [[Snapchat]] personality Ritchie repeating the phrase "liar, you are a liar".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Karim Benzema réfute sur Instagram la version sur son départ des Bleus de Didier Deschamps |url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Karim-benzema-refute-sur-instagram-la-version-sur-son-depart-des-bleus-de-didier-deschamps/1385223 |access-date=11 March 2023 |website=L'Équipe |language=fr}}</ref>
