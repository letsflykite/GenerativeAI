=== Anderlecht ===
Doku began playing football at a young age in [[Antwerp]] for KVC Olympic Deurne and [[K.

=== Rennes ===
'''2020-21: Debut season'''

On 5 October 2020, Doku signed for [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]] for five years, for €26 million in addition to bonuses, becoming the most expensive signing in the history of the club.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.getfootballnewsfrance.com/2020/official-jeremy-doku-signs-for-rennes-for-e26m-bonuses/ |title=Official: Jérémy Doku signs for Rennes for €26m + bonuses |website=Get French Football News |date=25 October 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.staderennais.com/jeremy-doku-est-rouge-et-noir |title=JÉRÉMY DOKU EST ROUGE ET NOIR ! |website=Stade Rennais |language=fr |date=25 October 2020 }}</ref> He scored his first goal for the French club on 20 March 2021 against Metz, but was sent off for a bad challenge later in the same match.<ref>{{Cite web |date=20 March 2021 |title=Jeremy Doku scores but is sent off as Rennes beat John Boye’s Metz |url=https://ghanasoccernet.com/jeremy-doku-scores-but-is-sent-off-as-rennes-beat-john-boyes-metz |website=GhanaSoccernet}}</ref> On 2 May against Bordeaux, Doku managed 12 successful dribbles, setting a new record in the [[French League 1]], with the previous one held by Brazilian star Neymar with 11 dribbles in PSG's game against Lyon in December 2020.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Amoako |first=Yaw Opoku |title=Jeremy Doku sets record with the most dribbles in a single game in French Ligue 1 |work=GhanaGuardian |url=https://ghanaguardian.com/jeremy-doku-sets-record-with-the-most-dribbles-in-a-single-game-in-french-ligue-1}}</ref> Of the ten players who attempted the most dribbles in the league competition, only Marseille midfielder Florian Thauvin had a better success percentage than Doku. In his debut season, Doku completed a total of 110 dribbles, the most by any player aged under 23 in Europe's top five leagues.<ref>{{Cite web |title=5 most valuable 19-year-olds in world football right now |url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/5-valuable-19-year-olds-world-football-right-now-saka-greenwood |website=Sportskeeda}}</ref>

'''2021-22: Injury problems''' 

In his second season at Rennes, Doku scored only one goal in [[French League 1|League 1]], having been limited to only 14 appearances by various injuries.<ref>{{Cite web |title=The many injuries are giving Jeremy Doku a tough time; it’s mentally difficult for him – Stade Rennais manager reveals |url=https://footballghana.com/the-many-injuries-are-giving-jeremy-doku-a-tough-time-its-mentally-difficult-for-him-stade-rennais-manager-reveals |website=Football Ghana}}</ref> He scored the opening goal against AS Nancy on 2 January 2022 in the fourth round of the [[Coupe de France]], however Rennes lost the match 5-4 on penalties, after the 120 minutes ended with the score 1-1.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Nancy - Rennes, le résumé du match |url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/match-direct/coupe-de-france/2021-2022/nancy-rennes-live/528684 |archive-date=3 June 2023 |website=L'Equipe}}</ref> 

'''2022-23: Return to form''' 

In the first part of the [[2022–23 Ligue 1|2022-23 season]], Doku was mostly brought on as a substitute by Rennes manager [[Bruno Génésio|Bruno Genesio]], but he returned to being a starter in the final months of the season. Following the departure of [[Kamaldeen Sulemana]] in the winter transfer window, Doku was given the number 10 shirt, having previously worn number 11.  

On 12 February 2023 against Toulouse, Doku played the full 90 minutes for the first time since 9 May 2021. Despite Rennes losing the match 3-1, Doku once again completed 12 dribbles, becoming the first player in Europe’s top five leagues in the season to tally ten or more dribbles in a single match. Doku had an assist in each of the two legs of [[UEFA Europa League]]'s knockout round play-off against Shakhtar Donetsk, but was unable to prevent his team from being eliminated from the tournament.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jeremy Doku provides assist in Stade Rennais defeat to Shakhtar Donetsk |url=https://footballghana.com/jeremy-doku-provides-assist-in-stade-rennais-defeat-to-shakhtar-donetsk |website=Football Ghana}}</ref> On 15 April, Doku scored his first brace for Rennes in a 3-0 home victory over Reims.<ref>{{Cite web |title=One to Watch: Jérémy Doku |url=https://www.ligue1.com/Articles/Ligue-1-Show/2023/05/11/one-to-watch-jeremy-doku |website=Ligue 1}}</ref> The two goals against Reims were the first for Doku on Rennes' home ground [[Roazhon Park]] since he arrived at the club. On 21 May, he scored the third goal in Rennes' 5-0 win away against AC Ajaccio, a magnificent solo effort where he started his run with the ball towards the opposition's goal from inside his team's half. Doku finished the season with six goals in the league, helping Rennes to a fourth place finish. 

==International career==
Doku represented the [[Belgium national under-17 football team|Belgium U17]]s at the [[2018 UEFA European Under-17 Championship]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.belgianfootball.be/fr/nouvelles/s%C3%A9lection-uefa-european-under-17-championship-2018|title=Nos -17 échouent en demi-finale - Union Royale Belge des Sociétés de Football-Association|website=www.belgianfootball.be}}</ref>

He made his first appearance for the Belgium national team on 5 September 2020 against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] in the [[UEFA Nations League]]. Three days later, he scored his first goal for the Belgium national team in a 5–1 win against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goal.com/en/match/belgium-v-iceland/report/6ziw11murei1tmjqbzxm1nxii |title=Belgium 5-1 Iceland: Red Devils top of group after rampant display |website=Goal.com |date=8 September 2020 }}</ref>

In the [[UEFA Euro 2020]], held in June 2021, Doku was one of the substitutes for the Belgium national team in their group stage match against Denmark, and was included in the starting line-up for the subsequent game against Finland; he was again named to the starting 11 for Belgium's quarter-final 2-1 loss against [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. Despite Belgium's elimination from the tournament, Doku captured the public's attention with his performance, winning a penalty for his side and completing 8 dribbles, a record for a teenager in the history of the Euro.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Memon |first=Taha |title=Belgium starboy Jeremy Doku shines against Italy - here's what he once said of Liverpool's interest in him |url=https://tribuna.com/en/news/liverpoolfc-2021-07-02-belgium-starboy-jeremy-doku-shines-against-italy-heres-what-he-once-said-of-liverpools-in/ |access-date=3 July 2021 |website=Tribuna}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Curtis |first=Leigh |date=2 July 2021 |title=Jeremy Doku would 'explode' at Leicester City amid stunning transfer demand |url=https://www.leicestermercury.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/jeremy-doku-leicester-city-transfer-5606128 |website=Leicestershire Live}}</ref>  

In November 2022, Doku was called up by manager [[Roberto Martínez]] to the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium squad]] that would compete for the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] held in [[Qatar]]. <ref>{{Cite web |title=FFT Belgium squad WC2022 |date=December 2022 |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/belgium-world-cup-2022-squad-players-line-up-qatar}}</ref> He made his World Cup debut as a substitute in Belgium's final group match against [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Julien |first=Laurens |title=Croatia reach World Cup round of 16 as Belgium's golden generation stay trophy-less |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/story/_/id/37634459/croatia-reach-world-cup-last-16-belgium-golden-generation-goes-home |website=ESPN}}</ref>

== Player profile ==

=== '''Style of play''' ===
Doku is equally adept at playing on the left wing and the right wing, although he is usually deployed as a right winger for Rennes. He is naturally right-footed, but he also has a strong left foot which he often uses to shoot at the goal after cutting in from the right side. An extremely quick and explosive player with great acceleration, agility, balance and body strength,<ref>{{Cite web |title=Wonderkids: Jérémy Doku |url=https://soccerment.com/wonderkids-jeremy-doku/ |website=Soccerment}}</ref> Doku is most famous for his elite dribbling skills, flair and trickery.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Terreur |first=Kristof |date=2 June 2021 |title=Jérémy Doku: the Belgium prodigy who got away from Liverpool |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/02/jeremy-doku-the-belgium-prodigy-who-got-away-from-liverpool |access-date= |website=The Guardian}}</ref> His low centre of gravity, body control, unpredictable footwork and rapid change of pace has helped him become one of the world's most effective forwards in one on one situations, ending up with the third best dribbling average per game in the Ligue 1 in 2021, after Neymar and [[Marco Verratti]],<ref>{{Cite web |date=16 March 2021 |title=Statattack Round 29: Doku the dribble king! |url=https://www.ligue1.com/Articles/News/2021/03/16/statattack-round-29-doku-the-dribble-king-mbappe-neymar |website=Ligue 1}}</ref> and top three in European league competitions in total dribbles in 2023 with [[Vinícius Júnior]] and [[Lionel Messi]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Bhavsar |first=Jimit |title=Top five players with most take-ons completed in 2022-23 season |url=https://khelnow.com/football/2023-06-world-football-players-most-take-ons-2022-23completed |website=KhelNow}}</ref> 

As a youth player, Doku was called "arrogant" for his tendency to wait for opposition defenders to recover so he could repeatedly beat them with the ball.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hendrix |first=Hale |title=Jeremy Doku Childhood Story Plus Untold Biography Facts |url=https://lifebogger.com/jeremy-doku-childhood-biography-story-facts/ |access-date=2 July 2023 |website=Life Bogger}}</ref> Doku described himself in 2021 as "a better dribbler than [[Kylian Mbappé]] and Neymar".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Peter |first=McVitie |title=NXGN star Doku: I'm a better dribbler than Neymar or Mbappe |url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/nxgn-star-doku-im-a-better-dribbler-than-neymar-or-mbappe/1rjht8kajxw8y1y1mbtb3puvnq |access-date=28 March 2021 |website=GOAL}}</ref> Doku also possesses excellent vision and crossing ability, completing more than 80 percent of his passes.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jeremy Doku – Renaissance Man |url=https://breakingthelines.com/player-analysis/jeremy-doku-renaissance-man/ |archive-date= |access-date=7 June 2023 |website=Breaking the Lines}}</ref> However, he has been criticized for his lack of end product,<ref>{{Cite web |title=One to watch: Jérémy Doku, Rennes' key to beating PSG? |url=https://www.ligue1.com/Articles/ONE-TO-WATCH/2021/05/03/jeremy-doku-rennes-key-to-beating-psg |access-date=5 March 2021 |website=Ligue 1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Caple |first=Alex |date= |title=How good is Jeremy Doku and why do Liverpool want him? |url=https://www.rousingthekop.com/2021/08/12/how-good-is-jeremy-doku-and-why-do-liverpool-want-him/ |access-date=6 July 2023 |website=Rousing The Cop}}</ref> having scored only 9 league goals in his first three seasons at Rennes.

Due to his direct playing style and African heritage, Doku has often drawn comparisons with Senegalese forward [[Sadio Mané]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jeremy Doku's performance for Belgium at Euro 2020 has Liverpool supporters excited |url=https://footballghana.com/jeremy-dokus-performance-for-belgium-at-euro-2020-has-liverpool-supporters-excited |access-date=22 June 2021 |website=Football Ghana}}</ref> He is also frequently compared to Belgian compatriot [[Eden Hazard]] and is seen as his successor in the Belgium national team. Doku considers Hazard to be his idol.<ref>{{Cite web |title=One to watch: Jérémy Doku, Rennes' key to beating PSG? |url=https://www.ligue1.com/Articles/ONE-TO-WATCH/2021/05/03/jeremy-doku-rennes-key-to-beating-psg |access-date=5 March 2021 |website=Ligue 1}}</ref>

=== '''Reception''' ===
The comparisons between Doku and Sadio Mané were sparked by German manager [[Jürgen Klopp]], who allegedly made the comment to Doku's father as he was trying to recruit the youngster to [[Premier League]] side Liverpool in 2017.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Taylor |first=Ryan |title=Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp 'told target he was Sadio Mane successor' in Melwood meeting |url=https://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/1618648/Liverpool-transfer-news-Jurgen-Klopp-Jeremy-Doku-meeting-Sadio-Mane |access-date=31 May 2022 |website=The Express}}</ref> Upon calling up Doku for the Euro 2020, Belgium manager [[Roberto Martínez]] described him as "an exceptional talent who is very strong one on one".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jeremy Doku is an exceptional talent - Belgium coach Roberto Martinez |url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/SportsArchive/Jeremy-Doku-is-an-exceptional-talent-Belgium-coach-Roberto-Martinez-1043362 |access-date=26 August 2020 |website=GhanaWeb}}</ref> Martínez also praised Doku ahead of the World Cup in 2022, saying: "When I talk about him, I have to smile. He's one of those players who can bring magic to his game."<ref>{{Cite web |title=2022 World Cup: Belgium coach Roberto Martinez praises Jeremy Doku ahead of tournament |url=https://footballghana.com/2022-world-cup-belgium-coach-roberto-martinez-praises-jeremy-doku-ahead-of-tournament |access-date=12 November 2022 |website=Football Ghana}}</ref> In April 2023, former Arsenal captain [[Thierry Henry]] called Doku "extraordinary", adding that "he has never seen anyone so quick in his dribble".<ref>{{Cite web |title=“Extraordinaire”: Thierry Henry bluffé par les qualités techniques de Jérémy Doku |url=https://www.7sur7.be/diables-rouges/extraordinaire-thierry-henry-bluffe-par-les-qualites-techniques-de-jeremy-doku~a8e7006d/ |access-date=18 April 2023 |website=7sur7 (in French)}}</ref> Former France international [[Samir Nasri]], who was briefly Doku's teammate at Anderlecht, described Doku as "an explosive dribbler" possessing "crazy quality" in one on one situations, and he predicted he will become one of the 20 best players in the world in the future.<ref>{{Cite web |title=One to watch: Jérémy Doku, Rennes' key to beating PSG? |url=https://www.ligue1.com/Articles/ONE-TO-WATCH/2021/05/03/jeremy-doku-rennes-key-to-beating-psg |access-date=5 March 2021 |website=Ligue 1}}</ref>

Doku has been commended for his work ethic and eagerness to learn. One of his youth coaches at Anderlecht told him that if he wants to play for a big club, he has to do more than dribbling, to which Doku responded by working on his passing and assist making.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hendrix |first=Hale |title=Jeremy Doku Childhood Story Plus Untold Biography Facts |url=https://lifebogger.com/jeremy-doku-childhood-biography-story-facts/ |archive-date=5 July 2023 |website=Life Bogger}}</ref> Former Rennes coach [[Julien Stéphan]] stated that he's was immediately charmed by Doku’s positive attitude, but that the player struggled mentally because of his lack of goalscoring.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Terreur |first=Kristof |date=2 June 2021 |title=Jérémy Doku: the Belgium prodigy who got away from Liverpool |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/02/jeremy-doku-the-belgium-prodigy-who-got-away-from-liverpool |archive-date=}}</ref> 

Both teammates and opponents have singled out Doku for his talent. In an interview for Belgian media, Rennes and Belgium defender Arthur Theate stated that “it’s impossible to defend against Jérémy Doku”.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Arthur Theate: “You can’t defend against Jérémy Doku” |url=https://euro.dayfr.com/sports/415908.html |access-date=7 July 2023 |website=DayFR Euro}}</ref> In 2021, PSG star [[Kylian Mbappé]] said “recently, I was speaking with my father about a player who impressed me because of his speed, and that is Doku at Rennes”, adding that “in five years as a professional, I have never seen someone demonstrate so much power from a standing start."<ref>{{Cite web |last=O'Calaghan |first=Rory |date=27 June 2023 |title="So much power..." - Kylian Mbappe blown away by Liverpool transfer target Jeremy Doku |url=https://www.sportbible.com/football/liverpool-transfer-news-mbappe-doku-rennes-424634-20230627 |website=SPORTbible}}</ref>

Doubts have been raised about Doku’s ability to stay fit, after an injury plagued season in [[2021–22 Ligue 1|2021-22]], where he suffered several muscular and knee injuries. The problems caused mental struggles for the teenager, as he kept coming back from injuries, getting some playing time, and then getting injured again.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Coach Stade Rennes: “Doku heeft het mentaal moeilijk” |url=https://www.voetbalbelgie.be/artikel/coach-stade-rennes-doku-heeft-het-mentaal-moeilijk |website=VoetbalBelgie}}</ref> However, Doku stated at the end of the 2022-23 season that after playing in several matches in a row over the final stretch, his mind now feels free from injuries, and when he is on the pitch he is “playing as if he is outside with friends”.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jérémy Doku no longer thinks about injuries: ‘The change is mental… from now on, I play as if I was with my friends’ |url=https://euro.dayfr.com/sports/366508.html |access-date=7 July 2023 |website=DayFR Euro}}</ref>  

== Personal life ==
Doku was born in Antwerp, Belgium and is of Ghanaian descent.<ref>{{cite web |title=Video: English giants Liverpool set to sign Ghanaian youngster Jeremy Doku |url=https://ghanasoccernet.com/english-giants-liverpool-set-to-sign-ghanaian-youngster-jeremy-doku |website=GhanaSoccernet}}</ref> He is the second child of parents David and Belinda and has one older brother and two younger sisters.
