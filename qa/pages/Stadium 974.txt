==Future use==
It was originally expected that the reassembled stadium would go to somewhere in Africa, but there are suggestions it may go to Uruguay, where it may be used for the [[2030 FIFA World Cup]] if the [[Uruguay–Argentina–Chile–Paraguay 2030 FIFA World Cup bid|Uruguay–Argentina–Chile–Paraguay bid]] succeeds.<ref>{{cite news |author=Josh Noble  |agency= |title=World Cup briefing: Final whistle blows for Qatar’s shortlived stadiums |url=https://www.ft.com/content/ef35d3e8-28e1-4e4a-89fc-2f8c39144aaf |quote= |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |date=2022-12-05 |access-date=2022-12-07 }}</ref>
