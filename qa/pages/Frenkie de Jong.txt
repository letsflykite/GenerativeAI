De Jong began his professional career at [[Willem II (football club)|Willem II]] in 2015. He transferred to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] for a fee worth €1 a year later. The fee was symbolic and offset by a sell-on clause. At Ajax he established himself as one of the best young midfielders in Europe, after winning a domestic double and reaching the Champions League [[2018–19 UEFA Champions League#Semi-finals|semi-finals]]. De Jong won the [[2018–19 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]] and [[2018–19 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]], was [[2018–19 Eredivisie#Annual awards|Eredivisie player of the season]], and was an instrumental part of Ajax's first [[UEFA Champions League]] semi-final appearance in [[1996–97 UEFA Champions League|22 years]], in a breakthrough [[2018–19 AFC Ajax season|2018–19 season]].

During his breakthrough season, De Jong agreed to sign for Barcelona in January 2019, leading him to be signed for the club in July, for a fee worth €75 million. De Jong was selected to the [[FIFPro#FIFA FIFPro Men's World11|2019 FIFA FIFPro World11]] and was one of three Dutch players to feature in it for the first time in five years.

De Jong made his senior international debut for the Netherlands in September 2018. He became a starter in the inaugural [[2018–19 UEFA Nations League|UEFA Nations League]], in which Netherlands finished [[2019 UEFA Nations League Final|runners-up]]. He also represented the side at [[UEFA Euro 2020]] and the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]].

Aged 20, he made 26 appearances for the first team.

He also played in a three-man center-midfield. He recorded eight assists in 22 league appearances and received two yellow cards. Towards the end of the season he was injured—tendonitis, syndesmotic ligament tear, hairline crack in calf bone—and missed three months. De Jong made two substitute appearances in the [[2017–18 UEFA Champions League|2017–18 Champions League qualification]], as Ajax lost on away goals against [[OGC Nice|Nice]] (3–3) in the third qualifying [[2017–18 UEFA Champions League#Qualifying rounds|round]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.football-oranje.com/ajax-suffer-frenkie-de-jong-blow/ |title=Ajax suffer Frenkie de Jong blow |date=28 February 2018 |website=Football Oranje |language=en-US |access-date=2 March 2019}}</ref>

Later that month he received praise from [[Rafael van der Vaart|Rafael Van Der Vaart]], who said De Jong was among the best players in Europe with the ball at his feet. It is unclear whether during or prior to the beginning of the campaign he rejected an offer from Tottenham Hotspur, saying the "moment wasn't right," and wanted to play a full season in his preferred position at Ajax.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11675/11683247/frenkie-de-jong-admits-he-nearly-joined-tottenham-before-barcelona-move|title=Frenkie de Jong admits he nearly joined Tottenham before Barcelona move|website=Sky Sports|language=en|access-date=10 December 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.football-oranje.com/de-jong-named-eredivisie-player-of-the-month-again/ |title=De Jong named Eredivisie player of the month again |date=28 February 2019 |website=Football Oranje |language=en-US |access-date=2 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.football-oranje.com/van-der-vaart-raves-about-de-jong/|title=Van der Vaart raves about De Jong: Best player in Netherlands|date=27 February 2019|website=Football Oranje|language=en-US|access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref>

De Jong achieved success, and widespread recognition, during the [[2018–19 AFC Ajax season|2018–19 season]] and led Ajax to their first domestic double (league and cup) since the [[2001–02 AFC Ajax season|2001–02 season]]. Ajax wrestled with [[2018–19 PSV Eindhoven season|PSV Eindhoven]] all season for the league, and finished the last five weeks at the top of the [[2018–19 AFC Ajax season#Eredivisie standings 2018–19|table]]. He made 51 total appearances and starred in Ajax's first leg (0–1) win over [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in the [[2018–19 UEFA Champions League knockout phase#Semi-finals|2018–19 UEFA Champions League semi-final]] at [[Tottenham Hotspur Stadium]]—in which De Jong had the most touches by any player on the pitch (87) and an 86.2 percent pass completion rate. It was the first time Ajax made the tournament semi-final since [[1996–97 UEFA Champions League|1997]]. The team eliminated Juventus (3–2 on [[Playoff format|agg.]]) in the [[2018–19 UEFA Champions League|quarterfinals]] and [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] (5–3 on agg.)

A versatile player, De Jong can function as a [[Playmaker#Deep-lying playmakers|regista]], [[defensive midfielder]], [[central midfielder]], [[holding midfielder]], [[box-to-box midfielder]] and [[centre back]]. He has been lauded for his combination of defensive stability and [[Playmaker|playmaking]] ability. He often partnered [[Matthijs de Ligt]] at centre-back, at Ajax. As a centre back, he abstained from committing fouls, showed great positional sense, and won possession frequently. In this more defensive role, his performances led to comparison with former German sweeper [[Franz Beckenbauer]] and likened his tendency to progress forward in possession, and ability to play-make, from defense to the German legend.<ref>[https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2018/7/7/17542760/profiling-barcelona-target-frenkie-de-jong Profiling Barcelona target Frenkie de Jong] Barca Blaugranes. 7 July 2018.

}}De Jong's vision has been praised alongside his ability to [[Dribbling#Association football|dribble]] in narrow spaces, control over possession, and decisive passing. A natural dribbler, De Jong has the highest dribbling success of all players to participate in all competitions, during his last season with Ajax.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Clark |first1=Gill |title=Frenkie de Jong to Transfer to Barcelona from Ajax at the End of the Season |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2817251-frenkie-de-jong-to-transfer-to-barcelona-from-ajax-at-the-end-of-the-season |access-date=21 January 2019 |website=Bleacher Report}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Myznikova |first1=Viktoria |title=Stat that makes Frenkie de Jong a worthy Ballon d'Or nominee |url=https://tribuna.com/en/news/fcbarcelona-2020-03-06-stat-that-makes-frenkie-de-jong-a-worthy-ballon-dor-nominee/ |access-date=1 August 2019|agency=Tribuna}}</ref> An extraordinary game-reader, he often makes offensive runs through the middle.

His other attributes include a penchant for [[Cross (association football)|long cross-field passes]], creating space, and absorbing attacking pressure. His close control, accuracy, work rate, and movement has drawn comparisons with Andrés Iniesta and [[Johan Cruyff]]. At Barcelona, he has primarily played on either side of a three-man central midfield. This has led experts and former players to regard him as a player with "Barça DNA" who was "born to play for Barcelona."<ref name="sensation" />

== Personal life ==
De Jong was born in [[Gorinchem]] and grew up in [[Arkel]], a town in the province of South Holland, where he started playing football at a young age. Since he started playing professionally, De Jong has chosen 21 on his shirt as a tribute to his grandfather who was born on 21 April.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{in lang|nl}} [https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2019/04/26/frenkie-goes-to-barcelona-a3958330 Frenkie goes to Barcelona] NRC Handelsblad, 26 April 2019</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/dec/06/frenkie-de-jong-ajax-manchester-city-barcelona|title=Ajax's Frenkie de Jong: 'I try to have a picture of where everyone is'|last=Steinberg|first=Jacob|date=6 December 2018|work=The Guardian|access-date=26 November 2019|issn=0261-3077}}</ref>
