===Early career===
Torreira started his youth football career at hometown club I.A. 18 de Julio of [[Fray Bentos]].

Before the 2014–15 season, Torreira was called up for Pescara's first team and, on 25 October 2014, he sat on the bench for the first time. He made his senior debut in [[Serie B]] on 16 May 2015 against [[Varese Calcio S.S.D.|Varese]], playing the game as a starter. He played 58 minutes before being replaced by [[Matteo Politano]].

===Sampdoria===
On 1 July 2015, Torreira was transferred to [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] for €1.5&nbsp;million, but he remained with Pescara on loan for the 2015–16 season to gain first-team experience.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/done-deal-sampdoria-sign-pescara-midfielder-lucas-torreira-4083811 |title=DONE DEAL: Sampdoria sign Pescara midfielder Lucas Torreira|date=1 July 2015|work=Tribal Football}}</ref> On 2 July, his loan to Pescara became official.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.sampdoria.it/en/torreira-out-to-earn-his-samp-stripes-im-here-for-the-long-haul/ |title=Torreira out to earn his Samp stripes: "I'm here for the long haul"|date=10 July 2016|publisher=U.C.

On 21 August 2016, Torreira made his [[Serie A]] debut in their opening game against [[Empoli F.C.|Empoli]] at the [[Stadio Carlo Castellani]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sampdoria.it/en/match/serie-a-tim-20162017-empoli-sampdoria-2/|title=U.C.

A week later, on 8 December, Torreira scored a late 83rd-minute winner against [[Huddersfield Town]] with a bicycle kick, giving him his second goal in as many games at the Emirates Stadium. In the match, Torreira was also awarded his fifth consecutive Arsenal Man of the Match performance.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46409328|title=Arsenal 1–0 Huddersfield Town|last=Skelton|first=Jack|date=8 December 2018|work=BBC Sport}}</ref> Torreira was dismissed in stoppage time during the club's reverse fixture against Tottenham at [[Wembley Stadium|Wembley]] after a late challenge on [[Danny Rose (footballer, born 1990)|Danny Rose]]. The match ended 1–1 and it was Torreira's first red card for Arsenal; although Arsenal attempted to appeal the ban, their appeal was rejected by the [[Football Association|FA]], which meant that Torreira's ban would still result in a three-match ban. As a result, Torreira would miss Arsenal's games against [[Manchester United]], [[Newcastle United]] and [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47340485|title=Tottenham Hotspur 1–1 Arsenal|last=McNulty|first=Phil|date=2 March 2019|work=BBC Sport|access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/sport/football/arsenal/lucas-torreira-handed-threegame-ban-after-arsenal-appeal-rejected-by-fa-a4083981.html|title=Arsenal midfielder Lucas Torreira handed three-game ban after appeal rejected by FA|last=Ouzia|first=Malik|date=6 March 2019|work=London Evening Standard|access-date=9 May 2019}}</ref> ESPN's [[Bill Barnwell]] named Torreira the third best signing of the Premier League season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/english-premier-league/23/blog/post/3851637/bill-barnwells-premier-league-winners-and-losers-2018-19|title=Bill Barnwell's Premier League Winners and Losers, 2018-19|date=14 May 2019|website=ESPN.com}}</ref>

==Style of play==
Upon signing for Arsenal in 2018, ''[[The Independent]]'''s Jack Austin stated "Torreira is exactly the kind of no-nonsense midfielder the club have been craving", adding that in Uruguay colours during the 2018 World Cup "he went about his job as the [[Midfielder#Holding midfielder|deep-lying pivot]] in the middle of the park with none of the fuss and all of the discipline of a player who has built a tidy reputation for himself in Serie A", while assessing his chief weaknesses as a lack of height in aerial duels and little goal threat.<ref>{{cite news|title=Arsenal transfer news: This is what Lucas Torreira will bring to Unai Emery's midfield, World Cup 2018 scouting report|first=Jack|last=Austin|work=The Independent|date=10 July 2018|access-date=12 July 2018|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/arsenal-transfer-news-lucas-torreira-who-profile-tactics-world-cup-2018-scouting-report-uruguay-a8440601.html}}</ref>
