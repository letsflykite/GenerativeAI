'''Breel Donald Embolo''' (born 14 February 1997) is a Swiss professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for [[Ligue 1]] club [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] and the [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland national team]].

Born in Cameroon, Embolo moved with his family to France before finally settling in Switzerland.

Shortly after moving to the [[Bundesliga]], he suffered an ankle injury that ruled him out for nearly a year. He later played in Germany for [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] and in the French Ligue 1 for Monaco.

Embolo made his senior international debut in 2015, earning over 60 caps. He represented Switzerland at the [[UEFA European Championship]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016]] and [[UEFA Euro 2020|2020]], and at the [[FIFA World Cup]] in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022]].

==Style of play==
[[File:Loco-Shal04 (3).jpg|thumb|Embolo challenging with [[Benedikt Höwedes]] of [[FC Lokomotiv Moscow|Lokomotiv Moscow]] in October 2018]]
[[UEFA|UEFA.com]] writer Steffen Potter praised Embolo as a complete striker: "He is powerful, technically strong and decisive. He has explosive pace and is a composed finisher." [[Fabian Frei]], who was a [[midfielder]] for [[FC Basel]] at the same time with Embolo, complimented him as well, for keeping his feet on the ground.<ref name="WK">{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2206596.html#wonderkids+breel+embolo |title=UEFA.com's weekly wonderkid: Breel Embolo |publisher=[[UEFA]] |date=7 February 2015}}</ref><blockquote>I think he is a sensation – playing like that aged 17. I like him as a person as much as I do as a player. His feet will stay on the ground – he won't be shooting from 50 metres to score the goal of the season. You can give him good advice and he is ready to take it without getting angry.</blockquote>

Embolo has cited [[Mario Balotelli]] as one of his inspirations. Both players like to lurk between defenders and both have great control allied to physical prowess.<ref name="WK" />

Embolo can also play in [[midfield]]; according to David Lemos of [[Radio Télévision Suisse]] he resembles [[N'Golo Kanté]] in this role, using his power to retrieve the ball and give it to the attackers.<ref name=four/>
