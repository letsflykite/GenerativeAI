==Style of play==
A hard-tackling and versatile defender, Silva is a physically strong, right-footed [[centre-back]], who usually features on the right-hand side of central defence, but he is able to play on both sides due to being comfortable at passing the ball with both feet. He is able to pass in different directions, whether to a teammate on the same side as him, or switching it to the opposing side or making vertical line-breaking passes, in order to dictate play in any direction from the back. He is known for being an accurate tackler, who is very good at winning back possession, and at anticipating and intercepting plays, due to his acute tactical intelligence, speed of thought, marking ability, positional sense and his ability to read the game. In addition to his defensive skills, he is comfortable on the ball, possessing good technical ability, as well as good distribution. He is also known for his ability to cover ground and put pressure on or anticipate opponents in positions higher up on the pitch.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://footballtalentscout.net/2022/08/12/antonio-silva/|title=António Silva Football Talent Scout|date=12 August 2022|access-date=19 October 2022}}</ref><ref name=career/> 

He is also known for his leadership skills, with former [[Portugal national football team|Portuguese]] international [[Abel Xavier]] commenting that for his "security, maturity, vision of the game, assertiveness, aggression, and for his leadership and not for his age, he can be the future captain of Benfica".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.record.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-bwin/benfica/detalhe/pela-sua-lideranca-e-nao-pela-sua-idade-antonio-silva-pode-ser-o-futuro-capitao-do-benfica|title="Pela sua liderança e não pela sua idade, António Silva pode ser o futuro capitão do Benfica"|trans-title=«For his leadership and not for his age, António Silva can be the future captain of Benfica»|newspaper=[[Record (newspaper)|Record]]|language=pt|date=19 September 2022|access-date=19 October 2022}}</ref><ref name=career/> Silva idolises compratriot [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and [[SL Benfica|Benfica]] legend [[Luisão]] and also cited compratriot [[Rúben Dias]], [[Antonio Rüdiger]] and [[Virgil van Dijk]] as inspirations.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.record.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-bwin/benfica/detalhe/antonio-silva-quer-seguir-os-passos-de-ruben-dias-olhem-para-o-que-ele-ja-atingiu|title=António Silva quer seguir os passos de Rúben Dias: «Olhem para o que ele já atingiu»|trans-title=António Silva wants to follow in the footsteps of Rúben Dias: «Look at what he has already achieved»|newspaper=[[Record (newspaper)|Record]]|language=pt|date=15 July 2022|access-date=19 October 2022}}</ref>
