==Style of play==
Dias is a physically strong, right-footed [[centre-back]], who usually features on the left-hand side of central defence, due to being comfortable at passing the ball with both feet. He is able to pass in different directions, whether to a teammate on the same side as him, or switching it to the opposing side or making vertical line-breaking passes. Combining his two-footedness with a very good passing range, Dias can dictate play in any direction from the back. Dias' strength on the ball when shielding it away from forwards running down his channel. Dias is very calm on the ball too and rarely finds himself in a heap of pressure. Dias is extremely proficient at passing, especially in longer passes, as his passing quality and ability is able to help his team retain possession. Dias is also dominant in the air, winning most of his aerial duels, as he looks to target his teammates and find them on a regular basis. Dias also uses his size to help him contest well in tackles, as he is also great at bodying up on players to win the ball back. He has a good-timing as he is able to anticipate a player's action or react for a "last-ditch" challenge.<ref name="Styleofplay2">{{Cite web |title=Player Analysis: Rúben Dias |url=https://breakingthelines.com/player-analysis/player-analysis-ruben-dias/}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://blog.betvictor.com/en-gb/sports/football/european-scout-report-joao-felix-and-ruben-dias/|title=European Scout Report: João Felix And Rúben Dias|website=BetVictor Blog}}</ref>

His Manchester City manager [[Pep Guardiola]], stated that "Dias a center back who leads the defensive line and in doing so helps others to make good decisions, the same happens in relation to midfielders [...] he is a player capable of living every moment of the game [...] always being focused on what he has to do and he makes his partner better."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.record.pt/internacional/paises/inglaterra/man--city/detalhe/guardiola-rendido-a-ruben-dias-e-o-que-acontece-quando-te-tornas-um-incrivel-central|title=Guardiola rendido a Rúben Dias: «É o que acontece quando te tornas um incrível central»|website=www.record.pt}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.record.pt/internacional/paises/inglaterra/man--city/detalhe/guardiola-rendido-a-caracteristica-de-ruben-dias-nao-e-facil-encontra-la-num-jogador-de-23-anos|title=Guardiola rendido a característica de Rúben Dias: «Não é fácil encontrá-la num jogador de 23 anos»|website=www.record.pt}}</ref> [[José Mourinho]] would praise Dias as the "best centre-back in world [...] for the [[Premier League]], [he's] gaining another level of experience, knowledge".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.record.pt/internacional/competicoes-de-selecoes/europeu/euro-2020/detalhe/mourinho-ruben-dias-e-o-melhor-central-do-mundo|title=Mourinho: «Rúben Dias é o melhor central do mundo»|website=www.record.pt}}</ref>

Former Manchester United defender [[Gary Neville]], stated that "Dias is the type of player who makes the whole team feel safe." Meanwhile, former [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] defender [[Jamie Carragher]] would compare Dias to legendary [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] defender [[Carles Puyol]], stating that "the amount of interceptions" during a [[UEFA Champions League]] match reminded him of legendary Premier League defender [[John Terry]], while also praising his "leadership skills".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.record.pt/internacional/paises/inglaterra/man--city/detalhe/carragher-e-neville-consideram-ruben-dias-o-melhor-jogador-da-premier-league-excecional|title=Carragher e Neville consideram Rúben Dias o melhor jogador da Premier League: «Excecional»|website=www.record.pt}}</ref>
