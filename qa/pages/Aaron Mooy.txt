This led to his nickname, the "Pasty Pirlo," drawing comparisons to the retired Italian star [[Andrea Pirlo]].<ref name="morningherald"/>

As Mooy moved to different clubs, including Western Sydney Wanderers, Melbourne City, Huddersfield Town, Brighton, Shanghai Port, and Celtic, his playing style evolved.

In terms of attacking contributions, Mooy has showcased his goal-scoring ability and his accuracy in shots on target.<ref name="celticway"/> He is also capable of making dangerous passes and has impressive vision and passing range.

As Mooy joined Celtic under manager Ange Postecoglou, he fit well into the team's 4-3-3 system as one of the "free eights" in midfield. His networking abilities and precise passing make him a vital asset in advancing the team's play. Despite lacking pace, Mooy's ability to protect and carry the ball effectively compensates for this. While Mooy's injury record raises concerns due to his age, his versatility and impact on the field remain significant. His awareness, vision, and set-piece-taking abilities make him a valuable asset in creating scoring opportunities for his team.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Brown |first1=Owen |title=The strengths and weaknesses of the four Celtic midfielders battling it out for two spots |url=https://theathletic.com/4128230/2023/01/27/celtic-midfield-scotland-tactics/ |website=The Athletic |language=en |date=27 January 2023}}</ref>

Mooy's individual achievements are notable as well.

==Personal life==
===Family and relationships===
During his early years, his mother, Sam, played an important role in Mooy's daily routine, driving him to and from training sessions since he didn't have a driver's license at the time. Sam describes Aaron as a "quiet soul" who prefers a low-key lifestyle, a characteristic she considers comes from his biological father. When he turned 21 during his time in [[Scotland]], Aaron opted for a meaningful celebration for his coming of age by requesting his 15-year-old brother, Alex, to join him rather than indulging in excessive drinking at a local pub.<ref name="morningherald1">{{cite web |last1=Lane |first1=Daniel |title=Tough look hides a grand design |url=https://www.smh.com.au/sport/soccer/tough-look-hides-a-grand-design-20130216-2eju2.html |website=The Sydney Morning Herald |archive-url=https://archive.md/XQwZL |archive-date=5 July 2023 |language=en |date=16 February 2013}}</ref>

===Heritage===
Throughout his journey as a professional footballer, Aaron Mooy has chosen to honour his personal values and heritage through tattoos. At the age of 16, he had a [[guardian angel]] tattooed on his shoulder, symbolizing the support he sought while being away from his family during his early days in [[Bolton]], England. The Dutch words "Leven, Lachen, Liefde" (Live, Love, Laugh) are also etched on his skin, representing his guiding principles.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Mitchell |first1=Thomas |title=Get to know ya boy, Aaron Mooy |url=https://www.sbs.com.au/whats-on/article/get-to-know-ya-boy-aaron-mooy/9crzr1akg |website=SBS What's On |language=en-AU |date=29 September 2017}}</ref> The name "Mooy," which Aaron's grandfather Australianized from "Mooij" after immigrating from Holland to Australia, holds significant meaning to him, representing his connection to his family's roots.<ref name="morningherald1"/>

Aaron Mooy's mother, Sam, emphasizes the importance of their family history and Aaron's relationship with his [[Dutch people|Dutch]] heritage. Although Aaron never met his Dutch grandfather, he deeply admires the man his mother describes. During his formative years, Aaron Mooy's stepfather, Alan Todd, played a pivotal role in his development as a footballer. Alan, a former [[rugby league|rugby league referee]], provided guidance and taught Aaron to use both his left and right foot effectively from a young age.
