==Style of play==
Sergej Milinković-Savic is a versatile [[central midfield]] player and is capable of playing in several roles, including as a [[trequartista]], or in a [[Holding midfielder|holding]] role, although he is usually deployed as a central midfielder, in the [[mezzala]] role. His style of play has drawn comparisons to [[Zinedine Zidane]] and [[Yaya Touré]], as he blends the traditional attacking movement, positional sense, and finishing ability of an [[attacking midfielder]], with the height and physicality of a [[target man]] or [[defensive midfielder]]; as such, he also is effective in the air, and is capable of scoring goals with his head as well as either foot, by making late runs from behind into the penalty area, or striking from distance. He possesses good technique, tactical intelligence, vision, and passing ability, despite his limited pace, as well as tenacity and excellent defensive work-rate, which enables him to help out at both ends of the pitch, carry the ball, and start attacking plays after winning possession. He has been nicknamed ‘il Sergente’ (the Sergeant) by Lazio fans for his charisma, physical dominance and for the assonance with his name.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thelaziali.com/index.php/2018/03/01/milinkovicsavic/|title=Player Profile: Sergej Milinkovic-Savic - The Laziali|work=The Laziali|date=1 March 2018|access-date=31 March 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mondofutbol.com/player/sergej-milinkovic-savic/ |title=SERGEJ MILINKOVIC-SAVIC |publisher=www.mondofutbol.com |language=it |last1=Luciano |first1=Aniello |date=25 July 2015 |access-date=7 December 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2849478-lazios-sergej-milinkovic-savic-says-the-manchester-united-story-is-finished |title=Lazio's Sergej Milinkovic-Savic Says 'The Manchester United Story Is Finished' |publisher=Bleacher Report |last1=Christopher |first1=Simpson |date=13 August 2019 |access-date=7 December 2019 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/the-gentleman-ultra/2017/jan/24/50-best-young-footballers-italy-serie-a |title=The 50 best young footballers in Italy |work=The Guardian |last1=Newman |first1=Blair |last2=Hodges-Ramon |first2=Luca |last3=Hall |first3=Richard |last4=Ficetola |first4=Franco |last5=Neale |first5=Mark |last6=Gates |first6=Emmet |date=24 January 2017 |access-date=7 December 2019 }}</ref>
