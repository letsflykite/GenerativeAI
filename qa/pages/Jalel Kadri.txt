His first coaching positions include [[AS Djerba]], [[AS Kasserine]], [[AS Gabès]] and [[US Monastir (football)|US Monastir]].

In 2013, he was assistant coach of the Tunisian team for a few games. From October 2013, he was once again a freelance coach at Saudi club [[Al-Nahda Club (Saudi Arabia)|Al-Nahda]]. For the 2014–15 season, he accepted this position at [[Al-Khaleej Club (Saudi)|Al-Khaleej Club]], where he accompanied the team for two seasons. From October 2017, he continued with [[JS Kairouan]], where he would only stay until March 2018. Shortly after, he was then under contract with [[CA Bizertin]], where he remained for the rest of the season. .

In the United Arab Emirates, he took the coaching position for the 2018–19 season at the [[Emirates Club]]. In turn, the following season, he remained completely at the [[Stade Tunisien]].
