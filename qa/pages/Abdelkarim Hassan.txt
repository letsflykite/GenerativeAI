On 21 December 2022, the management of Al Sadd announced that Abdelkarim Hassan has been excluded from the football first team permanently. This comes due to the player’s outlook not matching the goals and aspirations of the team for the upcoming period.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://al-saddclub.com/al-sadd-announce-abdelkarim-hassans-permanent-exclusion-from-the-team/ |title=Al-Sadd announce Abdelkarim Hassan’s permanent exclusion from the team |publisher=al-saddclub.com |date=21 December 2022 }}</ref> On 25 January 2023, Abdelkarim Hassan joined for [[Kuwaiti Premier League]] club [[Al-Jahra SC|Al-Jahra]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/25/01/2023/abdelkarim-hassan-signs-for-kuwaiti-al-jahra-sc |title=Abdelkarim Hassan signs for Kuwaiti Al Jahra SC |publisher=thepeninsulaqatar.com |date=25 January 2023 }}</ref>

==International career==

===Youth teams===
Abdelkarim scored a goal against [[United Arab Emirates national under-20 football team|UAE U20]] in the [[10th International Friendship Youth Tournament]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alittihad.ae/details.php?id=22440&y=2012|script-title=ar:منتخب الشباب يواجه اليونان في «الصداقة الدولية» الليلة|publisher=alittihad.ae|language=ar|date=5 March 2012|access-date=26 May 2014}}</ref>

In a friendly match against the Malaysia U-23 side on 17 June 2012, Abdelkarim sparked a mass melee between the two sides after a two-footed lunge on Mohd Azrif in the 43rd minute. He was duly shown a red card for his challenge. Afterwards, a Malaysian player, [[Nazmi Faiz]], ran half the length of the pitch to confront him, and punched him. Being 5 inches shorter than Abdelkarim, Nazmi's punch turned into nothing more than a push on his chest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest%2BNews/Sports/Story/A1Story20120618-353584.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120621001329/http://news.asiaone.com/News/Latest+News/Sports/Story/A1Story20120618-353584.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 June 2012|title=Nazmi loses cool in friendly against Qatar|publisher=asiaone.com|date=18 June 2014|access-date=26 May 2014}}</ref> Nazmi Faiz was shown a red card, whereas Qatar went on to lose 2–0.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://football.thestar.com.my/2012/06/18/harimau-muda-down-qatar-in-fiery-game-marred-by-free-for-all/|title=Harimau Muda down Qatar in fiery game marred by free-for-all|work=The Star|location=Malaysia|access-date=19 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619140513/http://football.thestar.com.my/2012/06/18/harimau-muda-down-qatar-in-fiery-game-marred-by-free-for-all/|archive-date=19 June 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>

He scored a goal in Qatar's opening game against Maldives in the qualifying stage for the [[2014 AFC U-22 Asian Cup qualification|2014 AFC U-22 Asian Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-afc.com/en/component/joomleague/?view=report&compID=438&matchId=4690 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20121209002304/http://www.the-afc.com/en/component/joomleague/?view=report&compID=438&matchId=4690 |url-status=dead |archive-date=9 December 2012 |title=Match summary |publisher=[[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] |date=23 June 2012 }}</ref>

===Senior team===
Abdelkarim made his debut for the senior national team on 18 November 2010 against [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://superkoora.com/st/index.php?ref=match&matchId=50541|title=Match report|publisher=superkoora.com|language=ar|access-date=26 May 2014|archive-date=1 December 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181201093425/http://superkoora.com/st/index.php?ref=match&matchId=50541|url-status=dead}}</ref>

He was the youngest player to appear in the preliminary squad list for the [[2011 AFC Asian Cup|2011 Asian Cup]] at the age of 17 years and 123 days old. He scored Qatar's only goal against [[Malaysia national football team|Malaysia]] in the [[2015 AFC Asian Cup qualification|2015 AFC Asian Cup qualifiers]] to ensure Qatar a berth in the Asian Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dohastadiumplusqatar.com/abdulkarim-goal-qatar-asian-cup-berth/|title=Abdulkarim goal gives Qatar Asian Cup berth|publisher=dohastadiumplusqatar.com|date=20 November 2013|access-date=26 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527220916/http://www.dohastadiumplusqatar.com/abdulkarim-goal-qatar-asian-cup-berth/|archive-date=27 May 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> He also scored a goal in Qatar's 4–1 victory against [[Yemen national football team|Yemen]] in the qualifiers.

Though his team lost all their group stage games in the [[2015 AFC Asian Cup]], he was extolled as one of the stars of the tournament. A [[FIFA]].com featured article theorized that he would form the basis of young players who go on to represent Qatar at the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/asiancup/news/newsid/251/960/8/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150703001702/http://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/asiancup/news/newsid/251/960/8/|url-status=dead|archive-date=3 July 2015|title=Bright new stars light up Asia|publisher=[[FIFA]]|date=3 February 2015|access-date=28 February 2015}}</ref>

He was named part of Qatar's squad for the [[23rd Arabian Gulf Cup]] held in Kuwait in from December 2017 to January 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.albawaba.com/sport/qatar-head-kuwait-aim-retaining-gulf-cup-title-1064632|title=Qatar Head to Kuwait with Aim of Retaining Gulf Cup Title|publisher=Al Bawaba|date=21 December 2017|access-date=15 September 2018}}</ref>

He was part of Qatar's squad at [[2019 AFC Asian Cup]] which helped them to win their first continental title. On 30 March 2021, he played his 100th match for Qatar in a 1–1 friendly match against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]].
