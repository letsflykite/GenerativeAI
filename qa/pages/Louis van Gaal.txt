'''Aloysius Paulus Maria "Louis" van Gaal''' ({{IPA-nl|luˈʋi vɑŋ ˈɣaːl|-|Nl-Louis van Gaal.ogg}};<ref>''Van'' in isolation is pronounced {{IPA-nl|vɑn|}}.</ref> born 8 August 1951) is a Dutch former [[association football|football]] player and manager. At club level, he served as manager of [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], [[AZ Alkmaar]], [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], as well as having three spells in charge of the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]]. Van Gaal is one of the greatest and  most decorated managers in world football, having won 20 major honours in his managerial career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/476816/WATCH-Manchester-United-boss-Louis-Van-Gaal-s-factfile |title=WATCH Manchester United boss Louis Van Gaal's career factfile |website=Sunday Express |access-date=6 September 2015 |first=Charles |last=Perrin |date=19 May 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11667/10731798/former-man-utd-boss-louis-van-gaal-retires-for-family-reasons |title=Former Man Utd boss Louis van Gaal retires for family reasons |website=Sky Sports |date=17 January 2017 |access-date=19 February 2017}}</ref> He is sometimes nicknamed the "Iron Tulip".<ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2015/02/life-and-times-iron-tulip-who-louis-van-gaal|title=The life and times of the Iron Tulip: Who is Louis van Gaal?|last=Bew|first=John|magazine=[[New Statesman]]|date=26 February 2015|access-date=21 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2016/may/22/louis-van-gaal-iron-tulip-muddled-thinker-manchester-united-jesse-lingard-fa-cup-final|title=Louis van Gaal: from Iron Tulip to muddled thinker at Manchester United|last=Jackson|first=Jamie|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=23 May 2016|access-date=21 September 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.ie/entertainment/books/biography-king-louis-van-gaal-is-the-iron-tulip-30524157.html|title=Biography: King Louis van Gaal is the Iron Tulip|last=Lui|first=Max|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|date=24 August 2014|access-date=21 September 2019}}</ref>

Before his career as a coach, Van Gaal played as a midfielder for [[Royal Antwerp F.C.|Royal Antwerp]], [[Stormvogels Telstar|Telstar]], [[Sparta Rotterdam]], Ajax and AZ Alkmaar. He is also a qualified [[physical education]] teacher, and worked at high schools during his career as a semi-professional footballer.<ref>{{cite book |first=Meindert |last=Van der Kaaij |title=Louis van Gaal |year=1997 |location=Utrecht |publisher=Kwadrat, cop |language=nl |isbn=90-6481-277-2 |page=43 onw}}</ref> After a brief spell as an assistant coach at AZ, Van Gaal served as an assistant under [[Leo Beenhakker]] at Ajax, and eventually took over as head coach in 1991. Under his lead, the club won three [[Eredivisie]] [[List of Dutch football champions|titles]], the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] and the [[UEFA Champions League]]. He moved to Barcelona in 1997 and won two [[List of Spanish football champions|league titles]] and one [[Copa del Rey]], but left after disagreements with the club's hierarchy.

Van Gaal was then appointed at the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], but failed to qualify for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. This preceded another brief spell at Barcelona, before he returned to AZ, where he won an Eredivisie title, the club's second ever in its history. He moved to Bayern Munich in 2009, and in Germany won the [[Bundesliga]], the [[DFB-Pokal]] and reached the final of the UEFA Champions League. He returned to manage the Netherlands for a second time, where he led the nation to a third-place finish at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. He was hired by Manchester United later that summer, where he won the [[2015–16 FA Cup|FA Cup]], before being dismissed in 2016. Despite announcing his retirement due to family reasons in 2019, Van Gaal returned to management in August 2021, when he was appointed as head coach of the Netherlands for a third time.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/aug/04/louis-van-gaal-named-as-netherlands-manager-for-third-time | title = Louis van Gaal named as Netherlands manager for third time | website = The Guardian | date = 4 August 2021 | access-date = 6 August 2021}}</ref>

==Playing and early coaching career==
Van Gaal was born in [[Amsterdam]].<ref name=BDFutbol/> As a youngster, he started playing for the Amsterdam amateur side RKSV de Meer. At the age of 20, he joined the second team of [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], but was never chosen to play in the first team, which at the time boasted players such as [[Johan Cruyff]] and [[Johan Neeskens]] in the midfield positions. He was loaned to [[Belgian First Division]] side [[Royal Antwerp FC|Royal Antwerp]] playing under [[Guy Thys]] with whom he was runner-up in the Belgian top division in [[1973–74 Belgian First Division|1974]] and [[1974–75 Belgian First Division|1975]]. During his time with Antwerp, Van Gaal suffered a broken nose in a friendly against [[K.V. Kortrijk]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=de Groote |first1=Raoul |title=Hoe Een Bodybuilder Avant La Lettre Van Gaals Neus Brak (in Dutch) |url=https://staantribune.nl/hoe-een-bodybuilder-avant-la-lettre-van-gaals-neus-brak/ |website=Staantribune |access-date=15 June 2018}}</ref> After four years spent in Belgium, he returned to his homeland and made his [[Eredivisie]] debut for [[Telstar (football club)|Telstar]] under the guidance of manager, [[Mircea Petescu]], whom he followed to [[Sparta Rotterdam]]. He later joined [[AZ Alkmaar|AZ]], where he also became assistant coach in 1986. After a short career at AZ, he returned to Ajax to become [[Leo Beenhakker]]'s assistant. When Beenhakker left in 1991, Van Gaal took over as manager.<ref name="ESPN Soccernet">{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/players/manager?id=99 |title=Louis van Gaal |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |access-date=21 May 2010}}</ref>

==Management career==

===Ajax (1991–1997)===
[[File:Nieuwe trainers Ajax na vertrek Linder Louis van Gaal , kop, Bestanddeelnr 934-3207.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Van Gaal in 1988 as assistant manager with Ajax]]
Van Gaal was Ajax manager from 1991 until 1997 and had a very successful tenure. Under Van Gaal, Ajax became the [[Eredivisie]] champions three times, in [[1993–94 Eredivisie|1994]], [[1994–95 Eredivisie|1995]] (notably going the entire [[1994–95 AFC Ajax season|1994–95]] season unbeaten in both the league and the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]]) and [[1995–96 Eredivisie|1996]].<ref name=colour>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/22/louis-van-gaal-manchester-united-colourful-controversial|title=Louis van Gaal – colourful and controversial but he is a serial winner|date=23 April 2014|access-date=24 April 2014|work=The Guardian}}</ref> He also led Ajax to the [[KNVB Cup]] in [[1992–93 KNVB Cup|1993]] and the [[Johan Cruyff Shield]] in 1993, 1994, and 1995. On the European scene, Ajax captured the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] in [[1991–92 UEFA Cup|1992]] and the [[UEFA Champions League]] in [[1994–95 UEFA Champions League|1995]] after beating [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] in the [[1995 UEFA Champions League Final|final]]. The latter win was followed by a 5–1 aggregate win over [[Real Zaragoza]] in the [[1995 UEFA Super Cup]]. Late in 1995, Ajax beat Brazilian side [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]] on penalties to win the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]]. Ajax were also Champions League runners-up in [[1995–96 UEFA Champions League|1996]] after losing to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] on [[Penalty shootout|penalties]].

Ajax was so successful under Van Gaal's leadership that during the 1990s, the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]] was dominated by Ajax players such as [[Patrick Kluivert]], [[Marc Overmars]], [[Dennis Bergkamp]], [[Frank de Boer|Frank]] and [[Ronald de Boer]], [[Edgar Davids]], [[Clarence Seedorf]], [[Winston Bogarde]], [[Michael Reiziger]], and [[Edwin van der Sar]].

After serving out his contract at Ajax in 1997, Van Gaal received his knighthood in the [[Order of Orange-Nassau]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.louisvangaal.nl/louis-van-gaal.html |title=Over Louis |trans-title=About Louis |publisher=louisvangaal.nl |access-date=21 May 2010 |language=nl |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100504082003/http://www.louisvangaal.nl/louis-van-gaal.html |archive-date=4 May 2010 }}</ref>

===Barcelona (1997–2000)===
Van Gaal moved to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in 1997, taking over from [[Bobby Robson]], and helped the team win two [[La Liga]] titles ([[1997–98 La Liga|1997–98]], [[1998–99 La Liga|1998–99]]) and the [[1997–98 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey]] once.<ref name=colour/> Despite this success, he clashed with the media and came under criticism. He expressed that it was difficult to implement his football philosophy at Barcelona due to cultural differences, and that he struggled hard as some players were unwilling to follow his lead.<ref name="Van Gaal quits Barca">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/holland/756865.stm |title=Van Gaal quits Barca |publisher=BBC |date=20 May 2000 |access-date=21 May 2010}}</ref> His rows with [[Rivaldo]] are an example of this: Van Gaal insisted Rivaldo play as a left winger, whereas Rivaldo argued that he wanted to play in the centre, in effect undermining Van Gaal.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/rivaldo-is-dropped-following-row-with-van-gaal-743006.html|title=Rivaldo is dropped following row with Van Gaal|last=Tynan|first=Gordon|date=22 December 1999|work=The Independent|location=London|access-date=21 May 2010}}</ref>

Van Gaal eventually left the Catalan side on 20 May 2000,<ref name="Van Gaal quits Barca"/> days after losing the [[1999–2000 La Liga|league title]] to [[Deportivo de La Coruña]], uttering the immortal line, "''Amigos de la prensa. Yo me voy. Felicidades''." ("Friends of the press. I am leaving. Congratulations.")<ref name="ESPN Soccernet"/> He returned to the Netherlands to manage the Netherlands national team in preparation for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]].

===Netherlands national team (2000–2002)===
Under Van Gaal, the Netherlands started their campaign to qualify for the 2002 World Cup poorly. Placed in [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 2|Group 2]], an injury-hit side could only manage to secure a late 2–2 draw at home to the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], having been 2–0 down with 20 minutes to go.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/jul/23/newsstory.sport11 |title=Joy of Six: Symbolic reducers |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=23 July 2007 |access-date=12 July 2014}}</ref> A 4–0 win over [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] was followed by a 2–0 defeat to [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]].

In 2001, the Netherlands beat [[Andorra national football team|Andorra]], [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus]] and [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]], but despite leading group leaders Portugal 2–0 with seven minutes left, drew 2–2 and fell three points behind second-place Republic of Ireland, who were unbeaten. When the sides met in [[Dublin]], Van Gaal boasted before the match that his squad was so much more talented, even the Irish fans would want them to qualify. Ireland went down to ten men after 58 minutes but scored nine minutes later and won 1–0. The Netherlands fell seven points behind them with two games left to play, meaning that they failed to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] for the first time since [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2011/nov/18/joy-of-six-republic-ireland-football |title=The Joy of Six: Republic of Ireland football moments |work=The Guardian |date=18 November 2011 |access-date=12 July 2014}}</ref> Van Gaal stepped down as manager on 31 January 2002 to be replaced by [[Dick Advocaat]]. After this, speculation began that Van Gaal would succeed [[Alex Ferguson|Sir Alex Ferguson]] at [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] once Ferguson claimed he would retire that year. According to Van Gaal, Ferguson decided against retiring and the deal fell through.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jan/23/newsstory.sport4 |title=Man U close in on Van Gaal |work=The Guardian |location=London |date=23 January 2002 |access-date=22 June 2010}}</ref>

===Return to Barcelona (2002–2003)===
Van Gaal returned to Barcelona for the start of the [[2002–03 FC Barcelona season|2002–03 season]] on a contract until June 2005, but results were inconsistent. The club won a record-equalling ten successive matches in [[2002–03 UEFA Champions League|the Champions League]] but struggled in [[2002–03 La Liga|La Liga]]. After four wins, four draws and three defeats from their opening 11 league matches, Barcelona lost three matches in a row, to [[Real Sociedad]], relegation-threatened [[Rayo Vallecano]] and [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]]. Two wins and a draw improved things but after successive defeats to [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] and [[Celta de Vigo]], he left by mutual consent on 28 January 2003 with the club in 12th place, just three points above the relegation zone and 20 points behind leaders Real Sociedad.<ref name="ESPN Soccernet"/>

His transfers, particularly the signings of goalkeeper [[Robert Enke]], midfielder [[Gaizka Mendieta]] and playmaker [[Juan Román Riquelme]], all disappointed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/2700353.stm |title=Van Gaal leaves Barca |publisher=BBC |date=28 January 2003 |access-date=10 May 2010}}</ref> Riquelme had been bought to replace Rivaldo, whom Van Gaal had released on a free transfer despite having a year left on his contract. The two had fallen out during Van Gaal's previous tenure and after Van Gaal returned, Rivaldo said, "Van Gaal is the main cause of my departure. I don't like Van Gaal, and I am sure that he doesn't like me, either."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/07/24/sports/24iht-soccer_ed3__7.html |title=Soccer: This time Rivaldo loses the ego war |work=The New York Times |date=24 July 2002 |access-date=12 July 2014}}</ref> Van Gaal replied that Rivaldo's lack of commitment was the reason he was released, saying that he "was only interested in making more money and playing less. He was chosen as the best player in 1999, but he has not handled himself well since then and has not behaved like a footballer should. He had illusions about Barca and was requesting to take holidays when important Champions League games were approaching. He then hides back home in Brazil. He plays for Brazil like we needed him to at Barcelona, and he has proved this in the World Cup finals, showing he reserved himself for Japan."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11833/2241655/van-gaal-hits-back-at-rivaldo |title=Van Gaal hits back at Rivaldo |publisher=Sky Sports |access-date=12 July 2014}}</ref> Rivaldo joined [[A.C. Milan]] and won that season's Champions League. However due to his poor performances throughout the season, he won the Bidone d'Oro Award in 2003, which is given to the worst Serie A player during a particular season <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archivio.tuttomercatoweb.com/2010/adriano-vince-il-bidone-d-oro-2010-242718|title=Adriano vince il Bidone d'Oro 2010 - TUTTOmercatoWEB.com|website=archivio.tuttomercatoweb.com}}</ref>

===Return to Ajax (2004)===
In 2004, Van Gaal returned to Ajax as a technical director, but resigned later that year due to an internal conflict with [[Ronald Koeman]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=247122.html |title=Van Gaal resigns from Ajax role |date=20 October 2004 |access-date=20 June 2014 |work=UEFA Official Website}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/football/10/20/netherlands.van-gaal/ |title=Van Gaal resigns from post at Ajax |date=20 October 2004 |access-date=20 June 2014 |work=CNN}}</ref>

===AZ (2005–2009)===
[[File:Louis-van-gaal4-CN.jpg|thumb|Van Gaal with AZ]]
In January 2005, it was announced that Van Gaal would replace [[Co Adriaanse]] as AZ manager on 1 July 2005.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.trouw.nl/krantenarchief/2005/01/15/2321188/Jacht_op_eerherstel_heropend.html |title=Jacht op eerherstel heropend |work=Trouw |date=15 January 2005 |access-date=10 May 2010 |language=nl}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/SPORT/football/01/14/alkmaar.vangaal/ |title=Van Gaal to take charge at Alkmaar |publisher=CNN |date=14 January 2005 |access-date=10 May 2010}}</ref> Under Van Gaal, AZ finished second in the Eredivisie in [[2005–06 Eredivisie|2005–06]] and third in [[2006–07 Eredivisie|2006–07]]. Van Gaal also led AZ to a runners-up finish in the [[2006–07 KNVB Cup]] and lost a [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League|2007–08 Champions League]] qualification play-off to Ajax 4–2 on aggregate.

Van Gaal initially announced he would leave AZ at the end of the [[2007–08 Eredivisie|2007–08 season]] due to disappointing results, with the club finishing 11th in the Eredivisie.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ruizenaar |first=Theo |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldFootballNews/idUKL2889958720080328 |title=Van Gaal to step down as AZ Alkmaar coach |work=Reuters |date=28 March 2008 |access-date=9 January 2010}}</ref> When several players of the AZ squad said that they would like him to stay with AZ, however, Van Gaal said he would give the players a chance to prove themselves.

AZ started the [[2008–09 Eredivisie|2008–09]] season with two losses: 2–1 to [[NAC Breda]] and 0–3 to [[ADO Den Haag]], but after that the Alkmaar-based club remained unbeaten until 18 April, topping the table ahead of [[FC Twente|Twente]] and Ajax for the entire season, despite being predicted to finish as low as 13th by pundits.<ref>{{cite news |last=Schaerlaeckens |first=Leander |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2009/apr/20/eredivisie-az-alkmaar-dutch-football |title=How AZ Alkmaar proved the pundits were way off target |date=20 April 2009 |access-date=2 August 2014 |work=The Guardian}}</ref> AZ had the best defensive record in the Eredivisie and the second-best goalscoring record, behind Ajax, thanks to its offensive duo of league topscorer [[Mounir El Hamdaoui]] and Brazilian [[Ari (footballer, born 1985)|Ari]]. They were crowned league champions on 19 April, one day after AZ suffered an unexpected loss at home to [[SBV Vitesse|Vitesse]], which ended a string of 28 unbeaten games (surpassing the team's [[1980-81 Eredivisie|1980–81]] record of 25 unbeaten games). That same day Ajax, which was the only opponent that would have been able to surpass AZ given a win, lost 6–2 to [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5j2aUlWUBM9Jzk4D7Amr-0THfFDpg |access-date=19 April 2009 |date=18 April 2009 |title=AZ Alkmaar loses 2–1 to Vitesse in Dutch soccer league Saturday |agency=The Canadian Press}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/canadianpress/article/ALeqM5iRdPaZUa1Ug7nV9ZOHEJrKv5cO0w |date=19 April 2009 |access-date=19 April 2009 |title=AZ Alkmaar wins Dutch First Division soccer title after PSV downs Ajax|agency=The Canadian Press}}</ref>

Van Gaal got off to a poor start as Bayern coach, winning only one of his first four matches in charge, and by November the club was on the brink of a [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League group stage|group stage]] exit following two losses to [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]]. With [[Bayer Leverkusen]] at the top of the Bundesliga, speculation was rampant that he was on the brink of a departure from Bayern even earlier than his predecessor [[Jürgen Klinsmann]]. Van Gaal, however, kept insisting he is a "''prozesstrainer''", meaning that his team needs time to play the way he imagines.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sueddeutsche.de/sport/fc-bayern-muenchen-ferguson-capello-1.31952|title=FC Bayern München, "Ferguson?

[[File:Philipp Lahm Louis van Gaal crop.jpg|thumb|left|Van Gaal with [[Philipp Lahm]] in 2009]]
Van Gaal installed many youth players as fixtures in the starting 11, including [[Thomas Müller]] and [[Holger Badstuber]], and also converted the winger [[Bastian Schweinsteiger]] into a defensive midfielder. A feud with Italian striker [[Luca Toni]], who had played an important role in Bayern's [[2007–08 FC Bayern Munich season|2007–08]] [[2007–08 Bundesliga|league]] and [[2007–08 DFB-Pokal|cup]] [[Double (association football)|double]], led to Toni's move to [[A.S. Roma|Roma]]. Bayern Munich's form, however, improved with two Champions League victories including an impressive 4–1 victory over [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in [[Turin]], which allowed them to progress from their group in second position behind Bordeaux. By March, Bayern had moved to the semi-finals of the [[2009–10 DFB-Pokal|DFB-Pokal]] and were top of the [[2009–10 Bundesliga|Bundesliga]], ahead of [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]].

===Return to Netherlands national team (2012–2014)===
[[File:Louis van Gaal 2013.jpg|thumb|upright|Van Gaal with the Dutch national team in 2013]]
On 6 July 2012, Van Gaal was presented as the new Netherlands coach.<ref name=Vangaaldutchreturn>{{cite news |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminaries/news/newsid=1661051/index.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710134643/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/preliminaries/news/newsid=1661051/index.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=10 July 2012 |title=Van Gaal returns to Dutch hot-seat |date=6 July 2012 |access-date=6 July 2012 |publisher=FIFA}}</ref> "I am happy that the KNVB approached me", said Van Gaal, who was assisted by former Dutch internationals [[Danny Blind]] and [[Patrick Kluivert]], both part of his successful Ajax squad from 1995. "This is the challenge which I have been waiting for."<ref>{{cite news |last=Scholten |first=Berend |url=http://www.uefa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=1839534.html |title=Van Gaal returns for second Netherlands spell 2012 |date=6 July 2012 |access-date=6 July 2012|publisher=UEFA Official Website}}</ref>

Van Gaal led the Netherlands through its [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group D|qualification group]] as the team won nine and drew one of their ten matches with a goal difference of 34–5. Qualification was secured with two matches to spare, following a 2–0 away win against Andorra on 10 September 2013.<ref>{{cite news|title=Van Persie delivers Netherlands World Cup ticket|url=http://www.uefa.com/worldcup/season=2014/matches/round=2000294/match=2008606/postmatch/report/index.html#dutch+book+finals+spot|access-date=13 July 2014|publisher=[[UEFA]]|date=10 September 2013|last=Scholten|first=Berend}}</ref>

Despite their successful qualifying campaign, expectations surrounding the Netherlands national team were comparatively low due to mixed pre-tournament friendly performances and the failure of the Dutch squad in Euro 2012, where they suffered three defeats out of three in the group stages in that tournament. In their first group game at the World Cup, at the [[Estádio Fonte Nova]] in [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], however, Van Gaal's Dutch team came from behind to defeat reigning champions Spain 5–1.<ref>{{cite news|title=Spain 1–5 Netherlands|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25285043|access-date=13 June 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=13 June 2014}}</ref> The Dutch victory over Spain was attributed in part to Van Gaal's use of counter-attacking tactics which disrupted the ''[[tiki-taka]]'' possession-based football of the Spanish team. His use of a [[Formation (association football)#3–5–2|3–5–2]] [[formation (association football)|formation]] was notable, as opposed to the typical Dutch [[Formation (association football)#4–3–3|4–3–3]] and this helped the Netherlands to tactically take advantage of Spain's weaknesses.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ramesh|first1=Priya|title=Tactical Analysis: How the Netherlands demolished Spain|url=http://www.benefoot.net/tactical-analysis-how-the-netherlands-demolished-spain/|access-date=18 June 2014|publisher=Benefoot.net|date=18 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140621194440/http://www.benefoot.net/tactical-analysis-how-the-netherlands-demolished-spain/|archive-date=21 June 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>
In their next match, the Dutch were trailing 2–1 to [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] in the second half of their second group game, before winning 2–3 with the winning goal from young substitute [[Memphis Depay]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sanghera|first1=Mandeep|title=Australia 2–3 Netherlands|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25285148|access-date=18 June 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=18 June 2014}}</ref>

Ahead of the last game in the group, Van Gaal accused [[FIFA]] of "playing tricks" in the scheduling of matches to advantage the home nation, as [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] were to play their last group match four hours after the Dutch, who they could meet in the round of 16 depending on their result. Brazil manager [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]] reacted by saying, "It was FIFA who chose the kick-off time. Some people expressed a view that we were going to choose who we were going to play. Those sorts of comments are either stupid or ill-intentioned." Van Gaal also criticised the referees who had awarded penalties against the Dutch in both of their matches, calling the decisions "unjustified" and "incorrect".<ref>{{cite news|title=World Cup 2014: Fifa unfair over fixtures – Louis van Gaal|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27970924|access-date=23 June 2014|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=23 June 2014}}</ref>

During their quarter-final match against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] in the World Cup, Van Gaal made the decision to substitute first-choice [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] [[Jasper Cillessen]] for [[Tim Krul]] in the final minute of [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]]; as Krul had not played at all in the Netherlands' four prior matches at the tournament, Van Gaal saved one of his three allowed substitutions to bring Krul on.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Netherlands 0-0 Costa Rica|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=255953/match=300186488/report.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140707105319/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/round=255953/match=300186488/report.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 July 2014|website=FIFA.com|publisher=Fédération Internationale de Football Association|access-date=29 October 2019}}</ref> This decision paid off, as Krul saved two of the Costa Rican penalties to send the Netherlands through to the semi-finals to face [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].
