The '''bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups''' was the process by which the [[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] (FIFA) selected locations for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s. The process began officially in March 2009; eleven bids from thirteen countries were received, including one which was withdrawn and one that was rejected before FIFA's executive committee voted in November 2010. Two of the remaining nine bids applied only to the 2022 World Cup, while the rest were initially applications for both. Over the course of the bidding, all non-European bids for the 2018 event were withdrawn, resulting in the exclusion of all European bids from consideration for the 2022 edition.  By the time of the decision, bids for the 2018 World Cup included [[England 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|England]], [[Russia 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|Russia]], a joint bid from [[Belgium–Netherlands 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|Belgium and Netherlands]], and a joint bid from [[Portugal–Spain 2018 FIFA World Cup bid|Portugal and Spain]]. Bids for the 2022 World Cup came from [[Australia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Australia]], [[Japan 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Japan]], [[Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Qatar]], [[South Korea 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|South Korea]], and the [[United States 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|United States]]. [[Indonesian 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Indonesia's bid]] was disqualified due to lack of governmental support, and Mexico withdrew its bid for financial reasons.

On 2 December 2010, Russia and Qatar were selected as the locations for the 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cups respectively. The selection process involved several controversies. Two members of the [[FIFA Executive Committee]] had their voting rights suspended following allegations that they would accept money in exchange for votes. More allegations of vote buying arose after Qatar's win was announced. Eleven of the 22 committee members who voted on the 2018 and 2022 tournaments have been fined, suspended, banned for life or [[2015 FIFA corruption case|prosecuted]] for corruption.

== Background ==
In October 2007, FIFA ended its continental rotation policy. Instead, countries that are members of the same confederation as either of the last two tournament hosts are ineligible, leaving [[Confederation of African Football|Africa]] ineligible for 2018 and [[CONMEBOL|South America]] ineligible for both 2018 and 2022.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/7067187.stm |work=BBC News |date= 29 October 2007 |access-date=29 October 2007|title= Fifa abandons World Cup rotation| url-status= live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030043406/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/7067187.stm |archive-date=30 October 2007 }}</ref> Other factors in the selection process include the number of suitable stadiums, and their location across candidate nations. Voting is done using a multiple round [[exhaustive ballot]] system whereby the candidate receiving the fewest votes in each round is eliminated until a single candidate is chosen by the majority.

=== Rotation policy ===
[[File:World Map FIFA2.svg|thumb|FIFA's confederations]]

Following the selection of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] hosts, FIFA had decided on a policy for determining the hosts of future editions. The six world confederations — roughly corresponding to continents – would rotate in their turn of providing bids, for a specific edition, from within their member national associations. This system was used only for the selection of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] (South Africa) and [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] (Brazil) hosts, open only to [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] and [[CONMEBOL]] members, respectively.

In September 2007, the rotation system came under review, and a new system was proposed which renders ineligible for bidding only the last two World Cup host confederations.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7013110.stm |title= New rotation proposal |work=BBC Sport |date= 25 September 2007 |access-date=22 October 2007| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011155608/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/7013110.stm| archive-date= 11 October 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> This proposal was adopted on 29 October 2007, in [[Zurich]], Switzerland by FIFA's executive committee. Under this policy, a 2018 bid could have come from [[CONCACAF]], [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]], [[UEFA]], or [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]], as Africa and South America were ineligible.<ref name=iht>{{cite news |url=https://www.smh.com.au/news/football/australia-can-host-world-cup/2005/09/17/1126750168444.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|title= Australia can host World Cup |first= Matthew |last= Hall |date= 18 September 2005|access-date=22 October 2007|url-status= live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901054158/https://www.smh.com.au/news/football/australia-can-host-world-cup/2005/09/17/1126750168444.html |archive-date=1 September 2006 }}</ref> Likewise, no CONMEBOL member could make a 2022 bid, and candidates from the same confederation as the successful 2018 applicant would be disregarded in the 2022 selection procedure.

The United States, the last non-European candidate in the 2018 bidding cycle, withdrew its bid for that year; hence the 2018 tournament would have to be held in Europe. This in turn meant that CONMEBOL and UEFA were ineligible for 2022.

== Voting procedure ==
For both the 2018 and 2022 editions of the World Cup, the [[FIFA Executive Committee]] voted to decide which candidate should host the tournament. The multiple round exhaustive ballot system was used to determine the tournament host. All eligible members of the FIFA Executive Committee had one vote. The candidate country that received the fewest votes in each round was eliminated until a single candidate was chosen by the majority. In the event of a tied vote, FIFA President [[Sepp Blatter]] would have had the deciding vote. There are twenty-four members on the committee, but two of those were suspended due to accusations of [[Electoral fraud|selling votes]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/football/12/02/football.world.cup.2018.2022/index.html?hpt=T1|title=Russia, Qatar win race to host World Cups as FIFA spreads its vision|date=2 December 2010|publisher=CNN|access-date=2 December 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101205020250/http://www.cnn.com/2010/SPORT/football/12/02/football.world.cup.2018.2022/index.html?hpt=T1|archive-date=5 December 2010|url-status=live}}</ref>

[[Alain Courtois]], a Belgian Member of Parliament, announced in October 2006 that a formal bid would be made on behalf of the three [[Benelux]] countries: Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg.<ref name="Benelux">{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=385813&cc=5901|title=Benelux trio to apply to host 2018 World Cup|date=16 October 2006|work=[[ESPN]]|access-date=18 October 2006|archive-date=1 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001045444/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=385813&cc=5901|url-status=dead}}</ref>

However, the city council of Rotterdam gave permission in March 2009 for development of a [[De Kuip#De Nieuwe Kuip|new stadium]] with a capacity of around 80,000 seats to be completed in time for the possible World Cup in 2018.
In November 2009, the venues were presented. In Belgium, matches would have been played in 7 venues: [[Antwerp]], [[Bruges]], Brussels, [[Charleroi]], [[Genk]], [[Ghent]] and [[Liège]]. In the Netherlands, only five cities would host matches: [[Amsterdam]], [[Eindhoven]], [[Enschede]], [[Heerenveen]] and [[Rotterdam]], but both Amsterdam and Rotterdam would provide two stadiums. Eindhoven would function as the 'capital city' of the World Cup.<ref>{{cite news

Japan also pledged that if it had been granted the rights to host the 2022 World Cup games, it would develop technology enabling it to provide a live international telecast of the event in [[3D television|3D]], which would allow 400 stadiums in 208 countries to provide 360 million people with real-time 3D coverage of the games projected on giant screens, captured in 360 degrees by 200 HD cameras. Furthermore, Japan will broadcast the games in holographic format if the technology to do so is available by that time. Beyond allowing the world's spectators to view the games on flat screens projecting 3D imaging, holographic projection would project the games onto stadium fields, creating a greater illusion of actually being in the presence of the players. Microphones embedded below the playing surface would record all sounds, such as ball kicks, in order to add to the sense of realism.

The Olympic bid was unsuccessful, coming third in the bidding process that concluded in October 2009. The vice-president of the [[Japan Football Association]], Junji Ogura, had previously admitted that if Tokyo were to fail in its bid, its chances of hosting either the 2018 or 2022 World Cup would not be very good.<ref>{{cite news

In the campaign presentation, PSSI president Nurdin Halid said he believed Indonesia stood a chance to win FIFA's approval to host the 2022 World Cup, despite the relatively poor infrastructure, coupled with the low quality of the national squad compared to other candidates. He said Indonesia had proposed a "Green World Cup 2022", hoping to capitalise on the current green and global warming movement worldwide: "Our deforestation rate has contributed much to world pollution. By hosting the World Cup, we wish to build infrastructure and facilities that are environmentally friendly so we can give more to the planet."<ref name="hotland"/>

The bid was launched at a moment when there were strong pressures from Indonesian football fans for Halid to step down from his position as chairman of PSSI.

Blatter noted that the committee had decided to "go to new lands" and reflected a desire to "develop football" by bringing it to more countries.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/03/sports/soccer/03worldcup.html?_r=1&hp|title=Russia and Qatar Win World Cup Bids|last=Longman|first=Jeré|work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=2 December 2010|date=2 December 2010}}</ref>

In each round a majority of twelve votes was needed. If no bid received 12 votes in a round, the bid with the fewest votes in that round was eliminated, and accordingly each remaining bid should receive no fewer votes in subsequent rounds than in preceding rounds. Multiple bids received fewer votes in voting round 2 compared to voting round 1 (Netherlands/Belgium, Qatar and Japan), at least 2 voting members in each of the 2018 and 2022 votes changed their votes between voting rounds despite their initial bid not being eliminated in voting round 1.

In July 2012, FIFA appointed former U.S. Attorney [[Michael J. Garcia]] to investigate allegations of vote-buying in the selection process. He submitted [[Garcia Report|the report]] in September 2014, which FIFA at the time declined to release in full. Instead, FIFA released a summary that Garcia described as "materially incomplete," leading Garcia to resign in protest.

In April 2020, the [[United States Department of Justice]] unsealed further indictments against voters Nicolás Leoz, Ricardo Teixeira, [[Julio Grondona]] of Argentina, and Jack Warner. The indictments spelled out how [[shell corporation]]s and sham consulting contracts were used to pay voters between $1–5&nbsp;million for their support. Other voters who had previously pleaded guilty to accepting bribes, including [[Rafael Salguero]] of Guatemala, aided in the indictments, which when included with previous cases, mean that more than half of the voters were accused of wrongdoing related to their votes.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.si.com/soccer/2020/04/06/world-cup-bribery-votes-2018-russia-2022-qatar-jack-warner |title= Indictment Reveals Details of Alleged Bribes for 2018, 2022 FIFA World Cup Votes |agency= Associated Press |website= Sports Illustrated |date= 6 April 2020 |access-date= 7 April 2020}}</ref> Voter [[Franz Beckenbauer]] has also been accused by Swiss prosecutors of embezzlement and money laundering related to voting in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup#Bribery and corruption allegations|2006 FIFA World Cup host selection]],<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.dw.com/en/franz-beckenbauer-probe-to-be-split-from-world-cup-investigation/a-49654583 |title= Franz Beckenbauer probe to be split from World Cup investigation |newspaper= Deutsche Welle |date= 19 July 2019 |access-date= 7 April 2020}}</ref> while [[Ángel María Villar]] was arrested in July 2017 for embezzlement, after previously being fined for failure to cooperate with investigations into vote-buying in the 2018 and 2022 host selection.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jul/27/angel-maria-villar-resigns-uefa-fifa-spain |title= Ángel María Villar resigns from Uefa and Fifa positions after arrest in Spain |newspaper= The Guardian |date= 27 July 2017 |access-date= 7 April 2020}}</ref>

Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] told his Qatari counterpart that hosting the tournament "is a big athletic event which can promote football in the Persian Gulf area and Middle East region." He also said Iran was ready to help Qatar in hosting the event, while saying he hoped its neighbours "could achieve a reasonable share to attend the games." al-Thani "underlined [a] necessity of cooperation between regional countries to use and take advantage of the sport opportunity." He also added that Qatar's initiative would motivate its neighbours to "promote and develop their football."<ref>http://cms.mfa.gov.ir/cms/cms/Tehran/en/Ifrem/1898912{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

There was also a backlash from the media in the losing countries; the majority of British newspapers alleged that the World Cup had been "sold" to Russia, and the Spanish ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', Dutch ''[[Algemeen Dagblad]]'', and the Japanese ''[[Nihon Keizai Shimbun|Nikkei]]'' made comments about the financial power of Russia and Qatar's commodity and energy reserves.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9253692.stm |work=BBC News | title=English media angry at Fifa 'fix' | date=3 December 2010 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206050527/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/9253692.stm | archive-date=6 December 2010 | url-status=live }}</ref> American newspapers the ''[[Seattle Times]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' alleged collusion and corruption.
