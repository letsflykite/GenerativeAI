'''Anis Ben Slimane''' ({{lang-ar|أنيس بن سليمان}}; born 16 March 2001) is a professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Danish Superliga]] club [[Brøndby IF]] and the [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia national team]].

Slimane had a tumultuous youth career, playing for eight different clubs in twelve years, but finally settled at [[Akademisk Boldklub|AB]] where he made his senior debut in 2018. The following season, he departed for [[Brøndby IF]] and was included in the U19-squad, but he would garner break-out attention in the second half of the 2019–20 season as he established himself as part of the first team.

Born in Denmark, Slimane has [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] and made appearances for both [[Denmark national under-19 football team|Denmark U19]] and [[Tunisia national under-20 football team|Tunisia U20]]. He represents Tunisia at senior international level.

==Career==
===Early career===
Slimane was born in [[Copenhagen]] and lived in the [[Vesterbro, Copenhagen|Vesterbro]] neighbourhood during his youth.<ref name="laeranisatkende">{{cite web |title=Lær Anis Slimane at kende - brondby.com |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fETxo8uHY-E |website=youtube.com |publisher=[[Brøndby IF]] |accessdate=24 April 2020}}</ref> He started playing for the lower levels of Vesterbro club BK Vestia at age 7, which was the club located most closely to his home.<ref name="laeranisatkende" /> After a few months he moved to the [[Kjøbenhavns Boldklub|KB]] academy due to his classmate playing there; a team his classmate's father also coached.<ref name="slimane060220" /> Later, Slimane and his classmate signed with the [[FA 2000]] academy, where they were joined by some other talented players. Because some clubs were hesitant to create first teams and second teams, Slimane moved to different clubs in Copenhagen, who were willing to commit to youth football at a higher level.<ref name="laeranisatkende" /> The following year, him and his classmate moved to [[Herfølge Boldklub]], where they were for a short period, before moving first to [[Boldklubben af 1893|B.93]], where they reunited with the group of talented youth players from FA 2000.<ref name="laeranisatkende" /> During his time at B.93, Slimane played in a UEFA European Club Championship tournament, where he impressed and therefore signed with the [[Brøndby IF]] academy.<ref name="slimane060220">{{cite web |title=Anis Slimane: Jeg havde en masse bump på vejen |url=https://brondby.com/nyhed/2020/02/06/anis-slimane-jeg-havde-en-masse-bump-paa-vejen |website=brondby.com |publisher=[[Brøndby IF]] |accessdate=24 April 2020 |date=6 February 2020}}</ref>

Slimane was twelve years old when he moved to Brøndby. He played for their academy teams for one and a half years before moving back to play for [[Kjøbenhavns Boldklub|KB]] at the under-13 level because of excessive travelling time to Brøndby after he and his family had moved to [[Høje Gladsaxe]].<ref name="slimane060220" /> Slimane's second stint at KB was, however, unsuccessful, and he, therefore, began to play for [[Lyngby Boldklub]].<ref name="laeranisatkende" /> He played in Lyngby's youth for six months before being signed by local club [[Akademisk Boldklub]] (AB) at under-14 level, where he once again reunited with his old classmates. Slimane stayed at AB for four years, ending his [[Journeyman (sports)|journeyman]] youth career.<ref name="slimane060220" /> There, he played for four years, breaking into the first team during his final time at the club. In an interview with the [[Brøndby IF]] website, Slimane described how he was among Denmark's greatest youth football prospects during his first years of playing, but those different circumstances meant that he had to fight for his breakthrough into professional football. During this period, he was close to retiring from football but his family and friends' support helped him through the difficult periods.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Helbo |first1=Benjamin Alexander |title=18-årigt Brøndby-talent var tæt på karrierestop |url=https://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/18-aarigt-broendby-talent-var-taet-paa-karrierestop/ |website=bold.dk |publisher=bold.dk |accessdate=24 April 2020 |date=6 February 2020}}</ref> During one summer, where he played in AB's youth academy, he experienced a large [[growth spurt]] in which he grew 15 cm, which enabled him to become more dominant physically and helped him develop as a player.<ref name="laeranisatkende" /><ref name="slimane060220" />

In January 2018, Slimane left on a one-week trial with German [[Bundesliga]] club [[SC Freiburg]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Nøhr |first1=Mikkel |title=Ungt AB-talent testes i Freiburg |url=https://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/ungt-ab-talent-testes-i-freiburg/ |website=bold.dk |publisher=bold.dk |accessdate=24 April 2020 |date=18 January 2018}}</ref> He made his first-team debut for AB on 7 April 2018 in a 2&ndash;1 home win over [[IF Lyseng Fodbold|IF Lyseng]], coming on as an 80th-minute substitute for [[Nichlas Rohde]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Sen sejr over Lyseng |url=https://www.ab-fodbold.dk/nyheder/2-division/180407sen-sejr-mod-lyseng/ |website=ab-fodbold.dk |publisher=[[Akademisk Boldklub]] |accessdate=24 April 2020 |date=7 April 2018}}</ref> Slimane made a total of 18 league appearances for AB in which he scored two goals.<ref name="SW" />
