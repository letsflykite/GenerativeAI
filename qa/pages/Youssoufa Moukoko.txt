On 8 December, Moukoko made his debut for Dortmund in the [[UEFA Champions League]] as a substitute against [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit Saint Petersburg]], becoming the youngest player in the competition's history at the age of 16 years and 18 days.

At the end of March 2021, he suffered an injury and was out until the end of the season.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

====2021–present====
In the 2021–22 season, Moukoko was also under new head coach [[Marco Rose]] in the striker hierarchy behind Haaland, [[Donyell Malen]] and sometimes [[Steffen Tigges]]. After nine games for the first team, in which the attacker prepared a goal (the game-winning 3–2 against [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim|Hoffenheim]]), this also came at the end of November 2021 for the first time for the [[Borussia Dortmund II|second team playing]] in the [[3. Liga|3rd division]]. In total, Moukoko played 16 Bundesliga games, scoring 2 goals. He also won the [[DFB-Pokal]] with the club, his first title in professional football.{{citation needed|date=January 2023}}

With the start of the [[2022–23 Bundesliga|2022–23 season]], Moukoko was used more frequently after the departure of Haaland and Tigges, as well as the [[Cancer|illness]] of newly-signed Haaland replacement, [[Sébastien Haller]]. He scored his first goal of the season against [[SC Freiburg]], in a 3–1 comeback victory for his side.<ref>{{Cite web |title=SC Freiburg vs. Borussia Dortmund - Football Match Summary - August 12, 2022 - ESPN |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/match/_/gameId/638447 |access-date=10 February 2023 |website=ESPN.com}}</ref> On 17 September 2022, he scored the decisive goal for Dortmund against [[FC Schalke 04]] in the [[Revierderby]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=17 September 2022 |title=Dortmund win the Revierderby vs Schalke thanks to 17-year-old Moukoko |url=https://www.marca.com/en/football/bundesliga/cronica/2022/09/17/6325f03fe2704e38a58b4575.html |access-date=26 October 2022 |website=MARCA |language=en}}</ref> Moukoko is a player that is widely touted to become one of the best strikers in the world.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-11-12 |title=5 Best FM23 Wonderkid Strikers you must sign! |url=https://fmbrotherhood.com/fm23/5-best-fm23-wonderkid-strikers/ |access-date=2023-02-11 |website=FMBrotherhood |language=en-us}}</ref>

==International career==
Born in [[Yaoundé]], Cameroon, Moukoko played for the [[Germany national under-16 football team|Germany national U16 team]] for the first time on 11 September 2017, in a 3–1 victory over [[Austria]]. Two days later, in his second match against the same opponent, he scored both goals for Germany in a 2–1 victory. At that time he was the youngest player in the U16s. In order to protect Moukoko from too much media attention, BVB and the DFB decided not to continue using him in selected teams for the time being.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://nachwuchs.bvb.de/Teams/U17/News/U17120 |title=Nur zwei Spieler in DFB-Kadern |website=nachwuchs.bvb.de |language=de|access-date=22 January 2020}}</ref>
