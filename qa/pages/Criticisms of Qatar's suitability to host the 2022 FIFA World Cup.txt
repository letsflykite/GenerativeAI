There were various '''criticisms of Qatar's suitability to host the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]]''', with the belief that it was unfit leading to [[Allegations of corruption and bribery related to the 2022 FIFA World Cup|allegations of corruption and bribery in the bidding process]] based on the belief that the unsuitability would have prevented it from being selected as host without corruption at play. There were further criticisms in the run-up to, and at, the World Cup, as unsuitable factors including the climate, cost, and elements of Qatari culture clashing with international tourism, came to the fore.

== Facilities and location ==

=== Stadiums ===

==== Involvement of Albert Speer ====
[[Albert Speer (born 1934)|Albert Speer]] (Jr), son of Hitler's chief architect and Minister of Armaments and War Production [[Albert Speer]] (Sr), was given the responsibility of designing the stadiums for the 2022 Qatar World Cup. [[Barney Ronay]], a senior sportswriter with ''[[The Guardian]]'', expressed disbelief that the Qatar Supreme Committee thought it "the best vibe, the best shout" to involve an architect who is reminiscent of the Nazis.<ref>{{cite news |last=Ronay |first=Barney |date=25 November 2022 |title=Stodgy England toil in cold footballing custard but the message is don't panic |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/25/stodgy-england-toil-in-cold-footballing-custard-but-the-message-is-dont-panic |quote=But it does certainly look like a tent. And a tent designed by Albert Speer, no less. This is not a misprint. It was the firm of Albert Speer Jr, son of the architect of the Third Reich, that just seemed like the best fit to the Supreme Delivery Committee, the best vibe, the best shout.}}</ref>

According to ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', "Speer's stadium designs are a significant reason why Qatar was awarded the 2022 football World Cup."<ref>{{cite news |title=The Search for Sustainability at the Qatar World Cup |work=Der Spiegel |url=https://www.spiegel.de/international/world/architect-albert-speer-interview-on-qatar-world-cup-a-1011520.html}}</ref>

==== Environmental impact ====
Each stadium in Qatar requires 10,000 litres of water per day in winter months, when the tournament is taking place, to maintain the pitch. With little access to freshwater in the nation, the sourced water was saltwater, which has to be [[Desalination|desalinated]]. The process damages the marine environment. Desalination plants in the Middle East also heavily rely on the use of fossil fuels. As well as the pitches at the stadiums, the organising committee grew and maintained a large farm of match-suitable fresh grass outside Doha, in case of turf damage. The need for so much desalination, and the oil and gas used to power the plants, have been criticised.<ref>{{cite web |date=2022-10-07 |title=10,000 litres a day for each pitch: water strain in the Gulf and the Qatar World Cup |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/07/10000-litres-day-pitch-qatar-world-cup-huge-impact-gulf-waters |access-date=2022-12-10 |website=The Guardian}}</ref>

One of the eight stadiums, [[Stadium 974]], was designed to be able to be disassembled so that it could be moved elsewhere, in an effort to counter the negative effect of requiring upkeep of unused stadiums. The large PR campaign promoting this was criticised by activists, as it overlooked the other stadiums being constructed in Qatar. Stadium 974 and the organising committee pledge that the tournament would be [[carbon neutral]] were also criticised as attempts to [[greenwash]] Qatar, the nation with the highest per-capita {{CO2}} emissions, especially as [[carbon neutrality]] was planned to be achieved by planting trees to offset emissions generated by the tournament, rather than use alternative energies. Stadium 974, located at a port, does not have air conditioning; due to the climate of Qatar, the other seven stadiums do, with the systems running on fossil fuels.<ref name="Sustainability">{{cite web |title=Qatar touts dismountable stadium for World Cup – DW – 11/25/2021 |url=https://www.dw.com/en/qatar-touts-dismountable-stadium-for-sustainable-2022-world-cup/a-59921732 |access-date=2022-12-10 |website=Deutsche Welle}}</ref>

=== Accommodation ===
In the days leading up to the tournament, videos emerged of the tournament accommodation, which consisted of shipping containers, some with a curtain leading to the exterior instead of four solid walls, and portable air conditioners. This accommodation cost over $200 a night. A [[Greek salad]] which costs $10, consisting of a small amount of lettuce, one slice of cucumber, and no [[feta]], served in a foam container was criticized as expensive and unpalatable. These criticisms led to comparisons to the ill-fated [[Fyre Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Marcin |first=Tim |date=2022-11-18 |title=The Qatar World Cup is already going viral for all the wrong reasons |url=https://mashable.com/article/world-cup-qatar-viral-disaster |access-date=2022-11-19 |website=Mashable |language=en}}</ref> Alcohol, where available, is expensive, with beer being $13.73 for 500ml.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Mills |first=Andrew |date=2022-11-17 |title=Beer to cost nearly $14 per half-litre inside Qatar's main World Cup fan zone - source |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/beer-will-cost-qr50-1373-per-500ml-cup-inside-main-fifa-zone-world-cup-qatar-2022-11-15/ |access-date=2022-11-19}}</ref>

One official fan village, comprising hundreds of shipping containers, still resembled a building site less than two days before the first World Cup match. People who had stayed in another village complained about the [[air conditioning]] and beds: "It has been hell. The air con in the cabin barely works and sounds like a [fighter jet] is taking off.... [The beds] are rock hard so you might as well sleep on the floor."<ref name="Ingle-18Nov2022">{{cite news |last1=Ingle |first1=Sean |date=18 November 2022 |title=World Cup fan village still a building site 48 hours before Qatar 2022 kicks off |work=Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/18/world-cup-accommodation-site-unfinished-with-abandoned-trucks |access-date=19 November 2022}}</ref> Due to these issues, which Qatar officials say were caused by "owner and operator negligence", Qatar offered refunds to fans who were "severely impacted".<ref>{{Cite web |last=Gilmour |first=Rod |date=2022-11-24 |title=World Cup officials offer full refunds to disgruntled fans |url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/world-cup-officials-offer-full-refunds-and-free-accommodation-to-disgruntled-fans-114119310.html |access-date=2022-11-26 |website=Yahoo News |language=en-AU}}</ref>

The [[Rawdat Al Jahhaniya]] fan village was criticised for its overpriced "night cabins" (£185 per night) made out of shipping containers. Tourists complained that the air conditioners in the cabins did not function well, facilities were falling apart, and the sleeping experience did not match their expectations.<ref>{{cite news |last1=McKern |first1=James |date=19 November 2022 |title=New photos reveal World Cup fan village unfinished just days out |work=Fox Sports |agency=News.com.au |url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/world-cup/new-photos-reveal-world-cup-fan-village-unfinished-just-days-out/news-story/95131f1dec31750cc45e1a6c4cfdc5d9 |access-date=21 November 2022}}</ref> The BBC reported that the tent accommodation at the Qetaifan Island fan village got criticism for having brown-colored tap water and no air conditioning other than a standing fan.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mk8VnlTpbo |title=Inside Qatar's fan village {{!}} World Cup 2022 |date=20 November 2022 |publisher=[[BBC Sport]] |access-date=13 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221204204434/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mk8VnlTpbo |archive-date=4 December 2022 |url-status=live |via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=22 November 2022 |title=Murky tap water, roasting heat, no loo roll: Inside Qatar's £175-a-night fan tents |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/news-and-advice/qatar-world-cup-fan-tents-b2230407.html |access-date=4 December 2022 |website=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> The tent village in [[Al Khor]] was criticized for having inconvenient transportation, a lack of alcohol, long waits to check in, and no locks on the tents.<ref>{{cite AV media |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUgYbFBWfA |title=Mixed reaction to Qatar 2022 accommodation |date=24 November 2022 |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |access-date=13 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221204231214/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAUgYbFBWfA |archive-date=4 December 2022 |url-status=live |via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Debre |first1=Isabel |date=23 November 2022 |title=Remote desert camps house World Cup fans on a budget |url=https://apnews.com/article/world-cup-sports-travel-soccer-qatar-3cfbb0de1758fef1d0a042a02b5624a6 |access-date=4 December 2022 |work=[[Associated Press]]}}</ref> The lack of suitable and affordable accommodation raised demand for daily shuttle flights from neighboring areas, such as Dubai, that had adequate numbers of hotel rooms.<ref>{{cite news |last=Debre |first=Isabel |date=24 November 2022 |title=World Cup fans put off by prices, beer limits commute by air |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |agency=Associated Press |url=https://www.seattletimes.com/business/world-cup-fans-put-off-by-prices-beer-limits-commute-by-air/ |access-date=24 November 2022}}</ref>

=== Use of migrant workers ===
{{Main|Human rights issues involving the 2022 FIFA World Cup#Migrant workers}}
There were criticisms of perceived human rights violations related to the organisation and hosting of this World Cup. There had long been concerns for the state of [[human rights in Qatar]], with the state accused of [[sportswashing]] in hosting the World Cup. A large concern in Qatar's hosting of the World Cup was the conditions of migrant workers brought in to build the required infrastructure, including indentured servitude and working conditions leading to deaths.<ref name="Atlantic 20223">{{cite magazine |date=19 November 2022 |title=The Qatar World Cup Exposes Soccer's Shame |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/11/qatar-hosting-fifa-world-cup-soccer/672171/ |url-status=live |magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Emerson Collective]] |issn=2151-9463 |oclc=936540106 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221119231915/https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/11/qatar-hosting-fifa-world-cup-soccer/672171/ |archive-date=19 November 2022 |access-date=20 November 2022 |author-last=McTague |author-first=Tom}}</ref><ref name="Reason 20222">{{cite magazine |last=Boehm |first=Eric |date=21 November 2022 |title=The Qatar World Cup Is a Celebration of Authoritarianism |url=https://reason.com/2022/11/21/the-qatar-world-cup-is-a-celebration-of-authoritarianism/ |url-status=live |magazine=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |publisher=[[Reason Foundation]] |oclc=818916200 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221121221030/https://reason.com/2022/11/21/the-qatar-world-cup-is-a-celebration-of-authoritarianism/ |archive-date=21 November 2022 |access-date=22 November 2022}}</ref><ref name="foreignpolicy3">{{cite magazine |date=25 November 2022 |title=Qatar Can't Hide Its Abuses by Calling Criticism Racist |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/11/25/qatar-cant-hide-its-abuses-by-calling-criticism-racist/ |url-status=live |magazine=[[Foreign Policy]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company]] |issn=0015-7228 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221127213633/https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/11/25/qatar-cant-hide-its-abuses-by-calling-criticism-racist/ |archive-date=27 November 2022 |access-date=28 November 2022 |author-last=Begum |author-first=Rothna}}</ref><ref name="JPost 20222">{{cite news |last=Frantzman |first=Seth J. |date=6 December 2022 |title=Is Qatar using anti-Israel sentiment to deflect from critique? – analysis |work=[[The Jerusalem Post]] |location=Jerusalem |url=https://www.jpost.com/middle-east/article-724202 |url-status=live |access-date=12 December 2022 |issn=0792-822X |oclc=15700704}}</ref><ref name="Comercio 2022">{{cite news |last=Benedetti |first=Eliezer |date=20 November 2022 |title="15.000 muertos por 5.760 minutos de fútbol": ¿Qué es #BoycottQatar2022 y por qué es tendencia todos los días? |language=es |work=El Comercio |url=https://elcomercio.pe/deporte-total/futbol-mundial/mundial-qatar-2022-que-es-boycott-qatar-2022-y-por-que-es-tendencia-todos-los-dias-copa-del-mundo-fifa-rmmd-dtcc-noticia/ |access-date=22 November 2022}}</ref>

On October 23, 2022, an article published by ''[[The Guardian]]'' included statements from migrants working on the World Cup 2022 infrastructure. In a survey of 1,000 low-wage workers, 86% of participants said that the labour changes had improved their lives. Better working conditions are now negotiable, and firms are motivated to offer them in order to attract and keep talent.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Pattisson |first=Pete |date=2022-10-23 |title=Has the World Cup really improved workers’ rights in Qatar?

Labour mobility is a result of changes to the [[Kafala system]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-12-04 |title=ILO Director-General concludes visit to Qatar |url=http://www.ilo.org/global/about-the-ilo/newsroom/news/WCMS_863118/lang--en/index.htm |access-date=2023-07-03 |website=www.ilo.org |language=en}}</ref>

The United Nations asserted in a report that "Qatar is transforming". According to [[Sharan Burrow]], general secretary of the International Trade Union Confederation, "the new Kafala system tranche of law will put an end to Kafala and establish a contemporary industrial relations system."

=== Scheduling ===
The notion of staging the tournament in winter proved controversial; Blatter ruled out a January or February event because it may clash with the [[2022 Winter Olympics]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Blatter: Qatar 2022 won't clash with Winter Olympics |url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/president/news/newsid=2221313/ |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128081035/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/president/news/newsid=2221313/ |archive-date=28 November 2013 |access-date=16 May 2014 |publisher=FIFA}}</ref> while others expressed concerns over a November or December event, because it might clash with the [[Christmas]] season (even though Qatar is predominantly Muslim, the players in the tournament are predominantly Christian).<ref>{{cite news |last=Rumsby |first=Ben |date=19 September 2013 |title=Fifa warned 2022 World Cup in Qatar must not clash with Winter Games |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/10321916/Fifa-warned-2022-World-Cup-in-Qatar-must-not-clash-with-Winter-Games.html}}</ref> The [[Premier League]] voiced concern over moving the tournament to the northern hemisphere's winter as it could interfere with the local leagues.

It's more like springtime in Europe". This was controversial within FIFA itself, due to a possible conflict with the Christmas season, and Vice-president [[Jim Boyce]] responded in saying that "it absolutely has not been decided as far as the executive committee are concerned.<ref name="Al Jazeera">{{cite web |title=FIFA split over Qatar World Cup dates – Football |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/sport/football/2014/01/qatar-2022-won-be-held-june-july-valcke-201418111355918402.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109202536/http://www.aljazeera.com/sport/football/2014/01/qatar-2022-won-be-held-june-july-valcke-201418111355918402.html |archive-date=9 January 2014 |access-date=17 February 2014 |publisher=Al Jazeera}}</ref>

It was agreed all the stakeholders should meet, all the stakeholders should have an input and then the decision would be made, and that decision as far as I understand will not be taken until the end of 2014 or the March executive meeting in 2015. As it stands it remains in the summer with no decision expected until end of 2014 or March 2015".<ref name="Al Jazeera" /> Another option to combat heat problems was changing the date of the World Cup to the northern hemisphere's winter, when the climate in Qatar would be cooler. However, this proved just as problematic as doing so would disrupt the calendar of a number of domestic leagues, particularly in Europe.<ref name="Rte.ie" />

[[Franz Beckenbauer]], a member of FIFA's executive committee, said Qatar could be allowed to host the 2022 World Cup in winter. He justified his proposal on the grounds that Qatar would be saving money, which otherwise they would have spent in cooling the stadiums. Beckenbauer said: "One should think about another solution. In January and February you have comfortable {{Convert|25|C}} there". "Qatar won the vote and deserves a fair chance as the first host from the Middle East".<ref>{{cite news |date=4 December 2010 |title=Qatar World Cup possible in winter |publisher=Al Jazeera |url=http://english.aljazeera.net//sport/2010/2010/12/201012414282409180.html |url-status=live |access-date=4 December 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101209054815/http://english.aljazeera.net/sport/2010/2010/12/201012414282409180.html |archive-date=9 December 2010}}</ref> At a ceremony in Qatar marking the occasion of having been awarded the World Cup, FIFA President Sepp Blatter later agreed that this suggestion was plausible,<ref name="aljazwinter">{{cite web |title=FIFA 'backs' winter 2022 Qatar cup – FOOTBALL |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/sport/football/2010/12/20101217143610760148.html |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220033310/http://english.aljazeera.net/sport/football/2010/12/20101217143610760148.html |archive-date=20 December 2010 |access-date=28 February 2012 |publisher=Al Jazeera}}</ref> but FIFA later clarified that any change from the bid position of a June–July games would be for the host association to propose.<ref>{{cite news |date=20 January 2011 |title=FIFA quashes talk of winter World Cup |work=Fox News Channel |url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2011/01/20/fifa-quashes-talk-winter-world-cup/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124073645/http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2011/01/20/fifa-quashes-talk-winter-world-cup/ |archive-date=24 January 2011}}</ref> Beckenbauer would later receive a 90-day ban from any football-related activity from FIFA after refusing to cooperate in the investigation of bribery.<ref>{{cite web |date=13 June 2014 |title=Franz Beckenbauer banned by Fifa for not taking part in World Cup inquiry |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/13/franz-beckenbauer-banned-fifa-qatar-world-cup |access-date=7 November 2014 |work=The Guardian}}</ref>

The notion of holding the Cup during Europe's winter was further boosted by UEFA President [[Michel Platini]]'s indicating that he was ready to rearrange the European club competitions accordingly.

In addition to objections by European leagues, [[Frank Lowy]], chairman of [[Football Federation Australia]], said a change of the 2022 World Cup date from summer to winter would upset the schedule of the [[A-League]] and said they would seek compensation from FIFA should the decision go ahead.<ref>{{cite web |author=Lutz, Tom |date=17 September 2013 |title=World Cup 2022: Australia wants Fifa compensation for failed bid |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/17/world-cup-2022-australia-compensation-fifa |work=The Guardian}}</ref> Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the [[Premier League]], stated that they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier League's popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme.<ref>{{cite web |author=Peck, Tom |date=24 February 2014 |title=Premier League chief Richard Scudamore threatens to sue over November/December proposal |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/premier-league-chief-richard-scudamore-threatens-to-sue-over-2022-winter-world-cup-10068066.html |url-access=limited |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225155030/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/premier-league-chief-richard-scudamore-threatens-to-sue-over-2022-winter-world-cup-10068066.html |archive-date=2015-02-25 |work=The Independent}}</ref>

In September 2013, it was alleged that FIFA had held talks with broadcasters over the decision to change the date of the World Cup as it doing so could cause potential clashes with other scheduled television programming. The [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] who had paid $425&nbsp;million for the right to broadcast both the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] and 2022 World Cups in the US, later voiced anger over the possible season switch, as doing so would clash with that year's [[NFL]] season, which takes place in the winter and with whom Fox also has a lucrative broadcasting deal. The network said they bought the rights with the understanding the tournament would take place in the summer, and if the change did go ahead they would seek compensation.<ref>{{cite web |author=Rumsby, Ben |date=26 September 2013 |title=Fifa holds secret talks with broadcasters over switching 2022 Qatar World Cup to winter |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/10338089/Fifa-holds-secret-talks-with-broadcasters-over-switching-2022-Qatar-World-Cup-to-winter.html |access-date=1 June 2014 |work=The Telegraph}}</ref>

In February 2015, FIFA awarded Fox the rights to the [[2026 FIFA World Cup|2026 World Cup]], without opening it up for bidding with [[ESPN]], [[NBC Sports|NBC]], and other interested American broadcasters.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=FIFA grants Fox, Telemundo U.S. TV rights for World Cup through 2026 |url=https://www.si.com/planet-futbol/2015/02/12/fifa-fox-usa-tv-rights-world-cup-2026-telemundo |magazine=Sports Illustrated |access-date=28 February 2015}}</ref> Richard Sandomir of ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that FIFA did so to avoid Fox from suing in U.S. courts, which under the American legal system could force FIFA to open up their books and expose any possible corruption.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Sandomir |first1=Richard |date=27 February 2015 |title=Why FIFA Made Deal With Fox for 2026 Cup |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/sports/soccer/why-fifa-made-deal-with-fox-for-2026-cup.html |access-date=28 February 2015}}</ref> As BBC sports editor Dan Roan observed, "It does not seem to matter to FIFA that rival networks ESPN and NBC may have wanted to bid, or that more money could have been generated for the good of the sport had a proper auction been held.

On 24 February 2015, it was announced that a winter World Cup would go ahead in favour of the traditional summertime event. The event was scheduled to be held between November and December. Commentators noted the clash with the Christmas season was likely to cause disruption, whilst there was concern for how short the tournament was intended to be. It was also confirmed that the [[2023 Africa Cup of Nations]] would be moved from January to June to prevent African players from having a relatively quick two-week turnaround, although the monsoonal rainy season in its host country [[Guinea]] starts about that time.<ref>{{cite news |title=Postponement of Afcon 2023 agreed - Jerome Valcke |publisher=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/31627049 |access-date=2 March 2015}}</ref>

=== Climate ===
{{see also|Effects of weather on sport}}
As the World Cup usually occurs during the northern hemisphere's summer, the weather in Qatar was a concern with temperatures reaching more than {{Convert|50|C}}. Two doctors from Qatar's Aspetar sports hospital in Doha who gave an interview in November 2010 to ''Qatar Today'' magazine said the climate would be an issue, stating that the region's climate would "affect performance levels from a health point of view" of professional athletes, specifically footballers, that "recovery times between games would be longer" than in a temperate climate and that, on the field of play, "more mistakes would be made". One of the doctors said that "total acclimation (to the Qatari climate) is impossible".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Qatar Today November 2010 |url=https://issuu.com/oryxmags/docs/qt_november_2010 |access-date=8 June 2021 |website=Issuu |language=en}}</ref>

The inspection team for evaluating who would host the tournament said that Qatar was "high risk" due to the weather. FIFA President Sepp Blatter initially rejected the criticism, but in September 2013 said the FIFA executive committee would evaluate the feasibility of a winter event instead of a summer one.

==== Move to November and December ====
Owing to the [[Climate of Qatar|climate in Qatar]], concerns were expressed over holding the World Cup in its traditional time frame of June and July.

The notion of staging the tournament in November was controversial because it would interfere with the regular season schedules of some domestic leagues around the world.

{{main|Football in Qatar}}

At the time of being awarded the tournament in 2010, [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]] was ranked 113 in the world,<ref>{{cite web |title=The FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking - Ranking Table.

The most prestigious accolade the team had won was the [[Arabian Gulf Cup]] twice, both times hosting. Since being awarded the tournament, they have also won the Arabian Gulf Cup for a third time in 2014 and the AFC Asian Cup in [[2019 AFC Asian Cup|2019]]. Qatar became the smallest country by land area to host the World Cup (less than half the size of [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]] hosts Switzerland, when the tournament consisted of 16 teams). These facts led some to question the strength of football culture in Qatar and if that made them unsuitable World Cup hosts.

The [[Qatar Football Association]] has also been known to [[naturalise]] players from foreign nations for its own team.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Best Eleven: Qatar National Team - Naturalized Players |url=http://www.thebesteleven.com/2010/11/qatar-national-team-naturalized-players.html |access-date=29 May 2015 |work=thebesteleven.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Graham Ruthven |title=Naturalization undermines international soccer. |url=http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/62922312/naturalization-is-undermining-the-credibility-of-international-soccer |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129052435/http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/62922312/naturalization-is-undermining-the-credibility-of-international-soccer |archive-date=29 November 2014 |access-date=29 May 2015 |work=SportsonEarth.com}}</ref> Examples include [[Sebastián Soria]], [[Luiz Martin Carlos Júnior|Luiz Júnior]] and [[Emerson Sheik]].

Whilst Jewish organisations complained of being unable to find cooked kosher food,<ref name=":23" /> the [[Government of Israel|Israeli government]] said it was happy with the efforts made by Qatar to meet its requests, including kosher food, direct flights from Israel to Qatar, and temporary diplomatic representation in the country.

Qatar attracted particular criticism for an incident where a Mexican employee of the World Cup Organizing Committee was accused of allegedly having [[Zina|sex outside of marriage]]. The woman had previously reported rape, while the male claimed to have been in a relationship with her, after which the woman was investigated for extramarital sex. Women in Qatar face the possible penalty of [[flagellation]] and a seven-year prison sentence if convicted for having sex outside of marriage. The criminal case was eventually dropped months after she was allowed to leave Qatar.<ref>{{Cite web |date=23 April 2022 |title=La mexicana acusada de adulterio en Qatar se libra de la prisión y los 100 latigazos |url=https://elpais.com/mexico/2022-04-03/la-mexicana-acusada-de-adulterio-en-qatar-se-libra-de-la-prision-y-los-100-latigazos.html |access-date=23 September 2022 |website=El Pais |language=es}}</ref>

In February 2022, the communications executive director at the supreme committee, Fatma Al-Nuaimi, stated in an interview that alcohol would be available in designated fan zones outside stadiums and in other Qatari official hospitality venues.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Baxter |first=Kevin |date=16 February 2022 |title=Qatar excited to welcome and show world its transformation during World Cup |url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/story/2022-02-15/qatar-excited-to-welcome-and-show-world-its-transformation-during-world-cup |access-date=29 March 2022 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref> In July 2022, it was reported that while fans would be allowed to bring alcoholic beverages into the stadiums, alcoholic beverages would not be sold inside the stadiums.

On 30 November 2022, ''[[The Times]]'' published an interview with some female fans attending [[2022 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup 2022]] games, with some of them saying that less drunkenness among other attendees made them feel safer at the stadiums than they expected.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Brown |first=David |title=Alcohol ban helps female fans enjoy hassle-free football in Qatar |language=en |newspaper=[[The Times]] |location=Doha |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/female-fans-referee-qatar-world-cup-beer-ban-6rd3z7cm7 |access-date=2022-12-07 |issn=0140-0460}}</ref>

As part of the Qatari bid, alcohol was to be permitted to be consumed around the stadiums. This was in contradiction to Qatari law which prohibits public consumption of alcohol and limits its consumption to high-end hotels. It was agreed that [[Budweiser]], FIFA's largest sponsor, would be permitted to sell their beer in designated areas in the stadium. Eight days before the tournament Qatari officials informed [[AB InBev]], the owners of Budweiser, that the beer tents were to be moved to less prominent areas and were no longer authorized inside the stadiums but still within the stadium perimeter.<ref name="New York Times">{{Cite news |last=Panja |first=Tariq |date=14 November 2022 |title=Qatar World Cup Faces New Edict: Hide the Beer |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/sports/soccer/world-cup-beer-fifa.html |access-date=19 November 2022}}</ref>

Two days before the tournament, on 18 November 2022, FIFA released a statement that sale points of beer would be removed from stadium perimeters in contradiction to both the Qatari bid and the earlier commitment when the sales were moved outside of the stadiums. FIFA's response was questioned as FIFA had forced recent World Cup hosts, such as Brazil, to change their laws to allow alcohol consumption at matches in line with sponsorship commitments.<ref name="BBC Sport">{{Cite news |last=Khalil |first=Shaimaa |date=18 November 2022 |title=World Cup 2022: Alcohol sales banned at World Cup Stadiums in Qatar |work=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63674631.amp |access-date=19 November 2022}}</ref> Alcohol was still permitted, however, inside the fan villages and inside the stadiums in the [[Luxury boxes|corporate hospitality boxes]], leading to claims of double standards.<ref name="Financial Times">{{Cite news |last=Noble |first=Josh |date=18 November 2022 |title=Qatar bans beer from World Cup stadiums |work=Financial Times |url=https://www.ft.com/content/76d786e6-35fc-443e-a0b7-a91682f15ba5 |access-date=19 November 2022}}</ref>
