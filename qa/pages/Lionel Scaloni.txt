'''Lionel Sebastián Scaloni''' ({{IPA-es|ljoˈnel eskaˈloni}},<ref>cf. [[Spanish phonology#Epenthesis]]</ref> <small>[[Rioplatense Spanish|Rioplatense]]:&nbsp;</small>{{IPA-all|ehkaˈloni|}}; born 16 May 1978) is an Argentine professional [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former player who currently coaches the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina national team]]. A versatile player, he operated as a [[right-back]] or [[right midfielder]].

Born in Pujato, Santa Fe, Scaloni debuted as a player for [[Newell's Old Boys]] in 1995. He spent most of his professional career in Spain, mainly at [[Deportivo de La Coruña]], with whom he won the [[1999–2000 La Liga|1999–2000 Spanish league]] title and the [[2001–02 Copa del Rey]]; in total, he amassed 258 games and 15 goals over 12 seasons in [[La Liga]] with three different teams. He also played for several years in Italy, with [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] and [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]], before retiring in 2015. Internationally, he played for Argentina at [[Argentina under-20 national football team|under-20 level]], and made his debut for the senior team in 2003; he won seven caps for the team between 2003 and 2006, and was part of their [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] squad.

Scaloni became a manager in 2016, starting as an assistant at [[Sevilla F.C.|Sevilla]] and Argentina's under-20 team. In 2018, he was named the outright manager of the under-20 team, and was chosen to lead the Argentina senior team later that year. With the senior team, he guided them to third place at his first international tournament, the [[2019 Copa América]], in Brazil. He won the [[2021 Copa América|2021 edition]], Argentina's first such honour in 28 years, and then beat [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the [[2022 Finalissima]]. Thereafter, the Scaloni-led national team won [[2022 FIFA World Cup|their third World Cup title]], the first since 1986, in 2022 in Qatar.
