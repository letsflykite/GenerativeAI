'''Cristiano Ronaldo dos Santos Aveiro''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Prince Henry|GOIH]] [[Order of Merit (Portugal)|ComM]]}} ({{IPA-pt|kɾiʃˈtjɐnu ʁɔˈnaldu}}; born 5 February 1985) is a Portuguese professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for and [[Captain (association football)|captains]] both [[Saudi Professional League]] club [[Al Nassr FC|Al Nassr]] and the [[Portugal national football team|Portugal national team]]. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, Ronaldo has won five [[Ballon d'Or]] awards{{refn|group=note|The terminology for the award has varied. Ronaldo received three Ballons d'Or as awarded by ''[[France Football]]'' magazine ([[2008 Ballon d'Or|2008]], [[2016 Ballon d'Or|2016]], [[2017 Ballon d'Or|2017]]) and two [[FIFA Ballon d'Or|FIFA Ballons d'Or]] ([[2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or|2013]], [[2014 FIFA Ballon d'Or|2014]]) as well as the [[2008 FIFA World Player of the Year]] and [[The Best FIFA Football Awards 2016|2016]] and [[The Best FIFA Football Awards 2017|2017]] [[The Best FIFA Men's Player|Best FIFA Men's Player]] awards.}} and four [[European Golden Shoe]]s, the most by a European player. He has won [[List of career achievements by Cristiano Ronaldo#Collective awards|32 trophies in his career]], including seven league titles, five [[UEFA Champions League]]s, the [[UEFA European Championship]] and the [[UEFA Nations League]]. Ronaldo holds the records for most [[European Cup and UEFA Champions League records and statistics#Players|appearances]] (183), [[List of UEFA Champions League top scorers#All-time top scorers|goals]] (140) and [[European Cup and UEFA Champions League records and statistics#Most assists|assists]] (42) in the Champions League, goals in the European Championship (14), [[List of men's footballers with 50 or more international goals|international goals]] (123) and [[List of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps|international appearances]] (200). He is one of the few players to have made over [[List of men's footballers with the most official appearances|1,100 professional career appearances]], and has scored over [[List of footballers with 500 or more goals|800 official senior career goals]] for club and country, making him the [[List of footballers with 500 or more goals|highest goalscorer of all time]]. He is the only player to score in [[FIFA World Cup top goalscorers#Goalscorers at multiple tournaments|five]] different [[FIFA World Cup]] tournaments.

Ronaldo began his senior career with [[Sporting CP]], before signing with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in 2003, winning the [[FA Cup]] in his first season. He would also go on to win three consecutive [[Premier League]] titles, the Champions League and the [[FIFA Club World Cup]]; at age 23, he won his first Ballon d'Or. Ronaldo was the subject of the then-[[most expensive association football transfer]] when he signed for [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] in 2009 in a [[Transfer (association football)|transfer]] worth €94&nbsp;million (£80&nbsp;million). He became a key contributor and formed an attacking trio with [[Karim Benzema]] and [[Gareth Bale]] which was integral to the team winning four Champions League wins from 2014 to 2018, including ''La Décima''. During this period, he won back-to-back Ballons d'Or in [[2013 FIFA Ballon d'Or|2013]] and [[2014 FIFA Ballon d'Or|2014]], and again in [[2016 Ballon d'Or|2016]] and [[2017 Ballon d'Or|2017]], and was runner-up three times behind [[Lionel Messi]], his perceived [[Messi–Ronaldo rivalry|career rival]]. He also became the club's [[List of Real Madrid CF records and statistics#Goalscorers|all-time top goalscorer]] and the all-time top scorer in the Champions League, and finished as the competition's top scorer for six consecutive seasons between 2012 and 2018. With Real, Ronaldo won four Champions Leagues, two [[La Liga]] titles, two [[Copa del Rey|Copas del Rey]], three [[UEFA Super Cup]]s and three Club World Cups. In 2018, he signed for [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] in a transfer worth an initial €100&nbsp;million (£88&nbsp;million), the most expensive transfer for an Italian club and for a player over 30 years old. He won two [[Serie A]] titles, two [[Supercoppa Italiana]] trophies and a [[Coppa Italia]], became the inaugural [[Serie A Awards|Serie A Most Valuable Player]] and became the first footballer to finish as top scorer in the English, Spanish and Italian leagues. He returned to Manchester United in 2021, finishing his only full season as the club's top scorer, before his contract was terminated in 2022. In 2023, he signed for Al Nassr.

Ronaldo made his international debut for Portugal in 2003 at the age of 18 and has since earned [[List of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps|200 caps]], making him Portugal's [[Portugal national football team#Most capped players|most-capped player]]. With more than 100 goals at international level, he is also the [[Portugal national football team#Top goalscorers|all-time top goalscorer]]. Ronaldo has played in and scored at eleven major tournaments; he scored his first international goal at [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]], where he helped Portugal reach [[UEFA Euro 2004 Final|the final]]. He assumed [[List of Portugal national football team captains|captaincy]] of the national team in July 2008. In 2015, Ronaldo was named the best Portuguese player of all time by the [[Portuguese Football Federation]]. The following year, he led Portugal to their first major tournament title at [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]], and received the [[UEFA Euro 2016#Awards|Silver Boot]] as the second-highest goalscorer of the tournament. This achievement would see him receive his [[2016 Ballon d'Or|fourth Ballon d'Or]]. He also led them to victory in the inaugural [[2018–19 UEFA Nations League|UEFA Nations League]] in 2019, receiving the [[2019 UEFA Nations League Finals#Awards|top scorer award]] in [[2019 UEFA Nations League Finals|the finals]], and later received the [[UEFA Euro 2020#Awards|Golden Boot]] as top scorer of [[UEFA Euro 2020|Euro 2020]].

One of the world's most marketable and famous athletes, Ronaldo was ranked the [[Forbes list of the world's highest-paid athletes|world's highest-paid athlete]] by ''[[Forbes]]'' in 2016 and 2017 and the world's most famous athlete by [[ESPN]] from 2016 to 2019. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' included him on their list of the [[Time 100|100 most influential people in the world]] in 2014. He is the first footballer and the third sportsman to earn US$1 billion in his career.

In his first season at Juventus, Ronaldo continued to play in a variety of different attacking roles under manager [[Massimiliano Allegri]], depending on whom he was partnered with. While he had occupied an increasingly offensive role in his final years at Real Madrid, at times he functioned in a free role at Juventus, either as a lone striker or in his trademark role on the left wing, in a 4–2–3–1 or 4–3–3 formation, in which he often switched positions with Mario Mandžukić. In this role, he was also given licence to drop deep or even out wide onto the right flank to receive the ball, and be more involved in the build-up of plays; as such, aside from scoring goals himself, he began to take on opponents and create chances for other players with greater frequency than he had in his final seasons with Real Madrid. Off the ball, he was also capable of creating space for teammates with his movement and attacking runs into the box, or finishing off chances with his head or feet by getting onto the end of his teammates' crosses.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/blog/espn-fc-united/68/post/3779061/juventus-twin-towers-of-ronaldomandzukic-to-provide-a-unique-test-for-atleticos-stingy-defence |title=Juventus' twin towers of Ronaldo, Mandzukic to provide a unique test for Atletico's stingy defence |publisher=ESPN FC |first1=Michael |last1=Cox |date=19 February 2019 |access-date=30 April 2019}}</ref><ref name="FreeRole">{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/italian-serie-a/story/3958370/ronaldos-free-role-with-juventus-is-a-headache-for-sarri-how-can-he-work-around-his-star |title=Ronaldo's free role with Juventus is a headache for Sarri.
