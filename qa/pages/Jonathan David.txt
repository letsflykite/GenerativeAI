'''Jonathan Christian David''' (born January 14, 2000) is a professional [[Association football|soccer]] player who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for [[Ligue 1]] club [[Lille OSC|Lille]] and the [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada national team]].

Born in [[Brooklyn]], United States, David moved to his parents' country of Haiti when he was still a baby, and immigrated to [[Ottawa]], Canada at the age of six. Raised in the [[Franco-Ontarians|Franco-Ontarian]] community of east Ottawa, he played for several local youth clubs before moving to Belgium in 2018, where he recorded his professional debut for [[K.A.A. Gent|Gent]]. Two years later, he joined French side Lille, where he aided in winning one Ligue 1 title and one [[Trophée des Champions]]. In 2019, David was named the male [[Canada Soccer Player of the Year]].

==Early life ==
David was born in New York City to Haitian parents, and moved to [[Port-au-Prince]] when he was three months old.<ref name="CSA" /><ref name="RCI" /> At the age of six, he and his parents emigrated from Haiti to Canada and settled in [[Ottawa]].<ref name="CSA" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60446193|title=The Lille striker tracked by Europe's elite|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref> Growing up, David went to the Francophone public school [[École secondaire publique Louis-Riel]]. He cites this as a reason for his success: "It helped to always have the ball at my feet when I was at Louis Riel."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Jonathan David, la nouvelle coqueluche du soccer Canadien |url=https://www.ici.radio-canada.ca/amp/1122870/jonathan-david-gent-nouvelle-coqueluche-football-soccer-canadien- |access-date=June 18, 2019 |publisher=CBC/Radio-Canada |archive-date=May 23, 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210523231909/https://ici.radio-canada.ca/amp/1122870/jonathan-david-gent-nouvelle-coqueluche-football-soccer-canadien- |url-status=dead }}</ref>
