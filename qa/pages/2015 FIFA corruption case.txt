In 2015, [[United States Attorney|United States federal prosecutors]] disclosed cases of corruption by officials and associates connected with the Fédération internationale de Football Association ([[FIFA]]), the governing body of [[association football]], [[futsal]] and [[beach soccer]].

Near the end of May 2015, fourteen people were indicted in connection with an investigation by the United States [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) and the [[Internal Revenue Service]] [[IRS Criminal Investigation Division|Criminal Investigation Division]] (IRS-CI) into [[wire fraud]], [[racketeering]], and [[money laundering]]. The [[United States Attorney General]] simultaneously announced the unsealing of the indictments and the prior guilty pleas by four football executives and two corporations.

The investigation revolved around [[collusion]] between officials of continental football bodies [[CONMEBOL]] (South America) and [[CONCACAF]] (Caribbean, Central and North America), and [[sports marketing]] executives. The sports marketing executives were holders of media and marketing rights for high-profile international competitions including the Americas' [[FIFA World Cup]] qualifying tournaments, and showpiece tournaments [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]] and [[Copa América]].

CONCACAF President [[Jeffrey Webb (football executive)|Jeffrey Webb]], also serving president of the [[Cayman Islands Football Association]], was arrested in connection with the investigation, as was former CONMEBOL President [[Nicolás Leoz]], while two sitting [[FIFA Executive Committee]] members were also arrested: [[Eduardo Li]] of the [[Costa Rican Football Federation]] and [[Eugenio Figueredo]], formerly of the [[Uruguayan Football Association]]. The investigation lasted several years, with the first arrest, of former CONCACAF president [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]]'s son Daryll, made in July 2013.<ref name="Actual Indictments">{{cite news|title=FIFA Indictments|newspaper=The New York Times|date=27 May 2015|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/27/sports/soccer/document-fifa-indictments.html|access-date=28 May 2015|archive-date=28 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528182732/http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/27/sports/soccer/document-fifa-indictments.html|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="DOJ-PR">{{cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-fifa-officials-and-five-corporate-executives-indicted-racketeering-conspiracy-and|title=Nine FIFA Officials and Five Corporate Executives Indicted for Racketeering Conspiracy and Corruption|date=27 May 2015|access-date=27 May 2015|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice]]|archive-date=27 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527093831/http://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/nine-fifa-officials-and-five-corporate-executives-indicted-racketeering-conspiracy-and|url-status=live}}</ref>

They were investigating Blazer's involvement in the bidding process for host countries for the FIFA World Cups from the early 1990s onwards.

In November 2013, Blazer pleaded guilty to 10 criminal charges including wire fraud conspiracy, money laundering, and offenses involving income tax and banking. Blazer's guilty plea had aimed to stave off a more serious charge of racketeering, which carried a potential 20-year prison sentence. Blazer would later make secret recordings of meetings with FIFA officials, and allegedly carried a recording device concealed in a keyring during the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] in London.<ref name="nydailynews.com"/> The [[Information (formal criminal charge)|information]] against Blazer (the charging document used in lieu of an indictment for a [[Plea bargaining in the United States|plea bargain]]) was revealed on 27 May 2015, the same day that the arrests were made in Zurich.<ref name=GuardBlazer>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/27/fifa-arrests-corruption-loretta-lynch-chuck-blazer|title=Fifa arrests: how a well-placed insider and stashed cash helped US build case|author=Dan Roberts|date=27 May 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=27 May 2015|archive-date=28 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528000401/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/27/fifa-arrests-corruption-loretta-lynch-chuck-blazer|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=NYTMay2715>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/28/sports/soccer/fifa-officials-arrested-on-corruption-charges-blatter-isnt-among-them.html|title=FIFA Officials Arrested on Corruption Charges; Sepp Blatter Isn't Among Them|author1=Matt Apuzzo|author2=Michael S.

The payment from the South African Football Association had been intended to support the development of football in the Caribbean. $1.6&nbsp;million of the South African payment was used by Warner to pay personal loans and credit cards and a further $360,000 was withdrawn by people connected to Warner. The Trinidadian supermarket chain JTA Supermarkets also received $4,860,000 from the FIFA payment.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-33039014|title=Fifa corruption: Documents show details of Jack Warner 'bribes'|work=BBC News|date=7 June 2015|access-date=21 June 2018|archive-date=13 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181013044043/https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-33039014|url-status=live}}</ref>

===Laws used in charging===
The Department of Justice has not charged anybody at FIFA with bribery. Prosecutors have instead alleged racketeering, [[Mail and wire fraud|wire fraud]], and [[money laundering]] conspiracies under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) Act, which was intended for use against the [[American Mafia|Mafia]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21653613-why-america-and-not-another-country-going-after-fifa-worlds-lawyer|title=The world's lawyer|newspaper=The Economist|date=6 June 2015|access-date=30 July 2015|archive-date=14 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814025617/http://www.economist.com/news/international/21653613-why-america-and-not-another-country-going-after-fifa-worlds-lawyer|url-status=live}}</ref> In addition, officials have been charged with violations of the Travel Act. The relevant part of the law essentially says that it is illegal to engage in interstate or foreign travel, or use the mails or "any facility in interstate commerce" to promote, manage, establish or carry on an illegal activity. That activity can be illegal under either federal or state law.<ref name="How America is pursuing FIFA">{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/06/economist-explains|title=How America is pursuing FIFA|newspaper=The Economist|date=1 June 2015|access-date=30 July 2015|archive-date=29 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150629202016/http://www.economist.com/blogs/economist-explains/2015/06/economist-explains|url-status=live}}</ref>

Bribery is definitely included on the list of what is considered an illegal activity under the Travel Act. Any relevant transaction, even if it is only tangentially related to America, can be targeted. In one instance, a representative of First Caribbean International Bank in the Bahamas flew to New York to pick up a cheque for $250,000 (the alleged bribe) from the bribe recipient to transport it safely back to the defendant's bank account.<ref name="How America is pursuing FIFA"/>

===Swiss criminal inquiries===
{{See also|Garcia Report}}
FIFA commissioned former United States Attorney [[Michael J. Garcia]] to investigate and [[Garcia Report|report]] on the [[2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids|bidding processes]] behind the awarding of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] to Russia and the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] to Qatar. In November 2014, FIFA made a copy of Garcia's report available to the Attorney General of Switzerland, who then stated that there were "grounds for suspicion that, in isolated cases, international transfers of assets with connections to Switzerland took place which merit examination by the criminal prosecution authorities".<ref name=GuardNov14>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/18/fifa-criminal-complaint-world-cup-bids|title=Fifa lodges criminal complaint with Swiss courts over World Cup bids|date=14 November 2012|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=26 May 2015|archive-date=29 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529022559/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/18/fifa-criminal-complaint-world-cup-bids|url-status=live}}</ref>
 
[[Sepp Blatter]] had been president of FIFA since 1998 (until his removal in December 2015). ''The Guardian'' said that FIFA's actions would "... inevitably be viewed with cynicism given Blatter's track record of using the Swiss courts and FIFA's regulatory processes to kick problematic issues into the long grass and deflect attention onto individuals who have already left football".<ref name=GuardNov14 />

In May 2015, on the same day as the arrests resulting from the FBI's investigation and in a separate action, the Swiss prosecuting authorities launched a criminal inquiry on "suspicion of criminal mismanagement and of money laundering" concerning the 2018 and 2022 bidding processes. The Swiss authorities seized "electronic data and documents" in a raid on FIFA's Zürich headquarters.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-32897157|title=Fifa corruption inquiry|date=26 May 2015|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=26 May 2015|archive-date=28 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150528124537/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-europe-32897157|url-status=live}}</ref> The Swiss police also planned to question ten members of the [[FIFA Executive Committee]] who participated in the December 2010 votes that chose the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 world cups.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32895048|title=Fifa corruption inquiry|date=27 May 2015|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=27 May 2015|archive-date=27 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527065003/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-32895048|url-status=live}}</ref>

In September 2015, Switzerland began investigating a payment Blatter authorised in 2011 to the president of the [[UEFA|Union of European Football Associations (UEFA)]] [[Michel Platini]] for work done between 1999 and 2002.<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/sepp-blatter/11891462/Sepp-Blatter-under-criminal-investigation-at-Fifa-live.html Sepp Blatter under criminal investigation by Swiss officials over 'disloyal payment' to Michel Platini – as it happened] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204071128/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/sepp-blatter/11891462/Sepp-Blatter-under-criminal-investigation-at-Fifa-live.html |date=4 February 2018 }}, ''The Telegraph'', 27 September 2015</ref> They also launched an investigation of possible "criminal mismanagement" by Blatter in a 2005 TV rights deal he signed with Jack Warner. In March 2017, FIFA submitted 1300 pages of reports to the Swiss Attorney General's office.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/la-sp-fifa-investigation-20170331-story.html|title=FIFA sends 1,300-page corruption investigation to Swiss attorney general|agency=Associated Press|website=Los Angeles Times|date=31 March 2017|access-date=20 February 2020|archive-date=24 July 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200724224825/https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/la-sp-fifa-investigation-20170331-story.html|url-status=live}}</ref> After investigation, in November 2021 Blatter and Platini were charged with fraud in relation to the 2 million Swiss franc payment made from FIFA funds to Platini in 2011.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-59133079|title=Ex-Fifa president Blatter and ex-Uefa boss Platini charged with fraud|work=BBC News|date=2 November 2021}}</ref>

===Television rights===
In September 2015, Swiss public television channel [[Schweizer Radio und Fernsehen|SRF]] published that Blatter would have sold the 2010 and 2014 FIFA World Cup rights in North America for US$600,000, a small fraction of their market value.<ref>[http://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/International/Did-Blatter-give-Warner-discount-20150912 Did Blatter give Warner discount?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151023092549/http://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/International/Did-Blatter-give-Warner-discount-20150912 |date=23 October 2015 }} – Sports 24, 12 September 2015</ref>

==Timeline of events==
===Historical events leading to the arrests===
In 2001, FIFA affiliate [[International Sports and Leisure]] went bankrupt in what were viewed in some circles as suspicious circumstances.<ref name=bung>{{cite news|last1=Jennings|first1=Andrew|author-link1=Andrew Jennings|title=The Beautiful Bung: Corruption and the World Cup|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/5070224.stm|access-date=10 June 2015|work=Panorama|date=11 June 2006|archive-date=7 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200907123450/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/5070224.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> In 2002 a FIFA [[whistleblower]] contacted British journalist [[Andrew Jennings]] relating to alleged corruption within FIFA itself.<ref name=miller>{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Michael E.|title=How a curmudgeonly old reporter exposed the FIFA scandal that toppled Sepp Blatter|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/03/how-a-curmudgeonly-old-reporter-exposed-the-fifa-scandal-that-toppled-sepp-blatter/|access-date=10 June 2015|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=3 June 2015|archive-date=9 May 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190509191215/https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2015/06/03/how-a-curmudgeonly-old-reporter-exposed-the-fifa-scandal-that-toppled-sepp-blatter/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Following investigations Swiss magistrate [[Thomas Hildbrand]] seized documents from FIFA offices in 2005<ref name=bung /> and in 2007 Jennings published a book – ''Foul'' – and broadcast the [[BBC]] ''Panorama'' documentary "The Beautiful Bung: Corruption and the World Cup".<ref name=miller /> ''Panorama'' later aired the "Fifa and Co" documentary in 2007, which contained an allegation of soliciting a bribe against [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]] and a court judgement that [[Jérôme Valcke]] had lied in FIFA business dealings.<ref>{{cite news|title=Fifa and Coe|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/7056420.stm|access-date=10 June 2015|work=[[BBC News]]|date=29 October 2007|archive-date=12 April 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412221442/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/panorama/7056420.stm|url-status=live}}</ref> These reports led the [[FBI]] to contact Jennings in 2009.<ref name=miller />

On 29 November 2010 the BBC broadcast ''[[FIFA's Dirty Secrets]]'', a second documentary by Jennings.<ref name=miller /> This was aired just days before the results of the [[2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids]] in Zurich, Switzerland. Following the bidding process, [[FIFA]] announced that Russia and Qatar had [[2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids|won the rights]] to stage the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022]] World Cups respectively. The result immediately caused controversies, as Russia is accused of a high level of racism in football and because of its involvement in the [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|2014 Ukrainian crisis]]. After it was announced that Russia would host the 2018 FIFA World Cup, Dr [[Rafał Pankowski]], a head of UEFA FARE Monitoring Centre, accused the Russian Football Union of downplaying racist chants in stadiums.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/03/world-cup-2018-russian-racism |title=World Cup 2018 win raises Russian racism fears |first=Rajeev |last=Syal |date=3 December 2010 |work=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=30 July 2015 |archive-date=12 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612144013/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/dec/03/world-cup-2018-russian-racism |url-status=live }}</ref>

The [[annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation]] in 2014 led to several British and American politicians calling on FIFA to overturn its decision of hosting the 2018 World Cup in Russia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-26679542|title=Fifa urged to rethink staging 2018 World Cup in Russia|publisher=BBC|date=21 March 2013|access-date=30 July 2015|archive-date=7 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407092515/http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-26679542|url-status=live}}</ref> Criticism from a number of media outlets, sporting experts, and human rights groups also highlighted problems such as Qatar's limited football history, the high expected cost, the local climate, and Qatar's human rights record.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/14-reasons-qatar-world-cup-174400894.html|title=14 reasons the Qatar World Cup is going to be a disaster|author=Tony Manfred|publisher=[[Yahoo!

In 2011, former [[MI6]] spy [[Christopher Steele]] began providing information and sources to the FBI, which helped advance the investigation.<ref name="yorker">{{cite magazine |magazine=[[The New Yorker]] |date=March 2018 |first=Jane |last=Mayer |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/12/christopher-steele-the-man-behind-the-trump-dossier |title=Christopher Steele, the Man Behind the Trump Dossier |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305154848/https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2018/03/12/christopher-steele-the-man-behind-the-trump-dossier |archive-date=5 March 2018 |quote=In 2011, Steele contacted an American agent he'd met who headed the Bureau's division for serious crimes in Eurasia.

In May 2011 a whistleblower later revealed to be Phaedra Almajid who was a member of the Qatari bid team for the 2022 World Cup, claimed that money was paid to FIFA's executive committee in order to buy votes.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/13345669|title=Caf's Hayatou and Anouma accused of taking Qatar bribes|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=13 February 2018|archive-date=17 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160117034201/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/13345669|url-status=live}}</ref> However, she retracted these claims in July 2011,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/14098944|title=Qatar 2022 'whistleblower' in corruption U-turn|author=David Bond|publisher=BBC Sport|access-date=13 February 2018|archive-date=11 January 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160111220204/http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/14098944|url-status=live}}</ref> later claiming that she had been coerced into making these retractions.<ref name="coerced-retraction" />

In May 2013, former [[CONCACAF]] executive [[Chuck Blazer]] was arrested (and later indicted) on bribery charges.

===Arrests===
On the morning of 27 May 2015, seven FIFA officials were arrested just before the start of the [[65th FIFA Congress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/9866259/reports-fifa-officials-arrested|title=Officials arrested in Switzerland ahead of FIFA meeting|work=Sky Sports|access-date=9 June 2015|archive-date=29 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150529234722/http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11095/9866259/reports-fifa-officials-arrested|url-status=live}}</ref> Two days later [[Sepp Blatter]] comfortably defeated [[Prince Ali bin Hussein]] to remain as President of FIFA.

On 27 May 2015, during the FIFA annual meeting at the Baur au Lac hotel in Zurich, authorities charged 14 officials, including nine current or former FIFA executives, including FIFA vice-president Jeffrey Webb. All faced extradition to the United States. On the same day, the Swiss attorney general's office said that other FIFA executives were being questioned on suspicion of "criminal mismanagement" and money laundering.<ref>{{cite news |last=Gibson |first=Owen |date=27 May 2015 |title=Fifa officials arrested on corruption charges as World Cup inquiry launched |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/27/several-top-fifa-officials-arrested |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London, England |access-date=3 December 2015 |archive-date=27 May 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527081541/http://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/27/several-top-fifa-officials-arrested |url-status=live }}</ref>

The following day, South Africa sports minister [[Fikile Mbalula]] denied the $10&nbsp;million payment to Warner was a bribe.

Later that day, the [[FBI]] unsealed the transcript of the [[allocution]] made by former FIFA member and head of [[CONCACAF]], [[Chuck Blazer]] which he had made when he pleaded guilty in 2013 to various charges as part of an apparent [[plea bargain]]. In Blazer's partially-[[Sanitization (classified information)|redacted]] allocution, he claimed that he "and others, while acting in our official capacities, agreed to participate in a scheme to defraud [[FIFA]] and [[CONCACAF]] of the right to honest services by taking undisclosed bribes" and that he had "agreed with others in or around 1992 to facilitate the acceptance of a bribe in conjunction with the selection of the host nation for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]].

On 12 June 2015, an international law enforcement agency [[Interpol]] announced it was suspending a 20 million euro donation by [[FIFA]] to fund an anti-gambling and match-fixing program.

An Interpol spokesman said, "The agreement with FIFA includes a clause which states that 'the Funding Party declares notably that its activities are compatible with the principles, aims and activities of Interpol'. All external partners, whether public or private, must share the fundamental values and principles of the organisation, as well as the wider law enforcement community."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.interpol.int/News-and-media/News/2015/N2015-080 |title=INTERPOL suspends agreement with FIFA |access-date=12 June 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615002030/http://www.interpol.int/News-and-media/News/2015/N2015-080 |archive-date=15 June 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>
