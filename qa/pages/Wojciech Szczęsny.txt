'''Wojciech Tomasz Szczęsny''' ({{IPA-pl|ˈvɔjt͡ɕɛx ˈtɔmaʂ ˈʂt͡ʂɛ̃snɨ|3=Pl-Wojciech Szczesny.ogg}}; born 18 April 1990) is a Polish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{Italian football updater|Juventus}} club [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] and the [[Poland national football team|Poland national team]].

After starting his club career at [[Legia Warsaw]], Szczęsny signed for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in January 2006, where he made his professional debut in 2009. After a spell on loan with [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] the following season, he later became the capital club's first choice goalkeeper, winning two [[FA Cup]]s and being the joint recipient of the [[2013–14 Premier League|2013–14]] [[Premier League Golden Glove]] with [[Petr Čech]]. He subsequently went on two consecutive season-long loans to Italian club [[A.S. Roma|Roma]] in 2015, where his performances earned him a move to reigning league champions [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] in 2017. After serving mainly as a back-up to [[Gianluigi Buffon]] in his first season, during which he won a domestic double, he inherited the starting spot from the departed Buffon the following season, winning his second Serie A title; his performances also earned him a [[Yashin Trophy]] nomination in 2019.<ref name="2019 Yashin Trophy">{{cite news|first=Manu|last=Sainz|url=https://en.as.com/en/2019/12/02/football/1575288628_506101.html|title=Ballon d'Or 2019: Yachine Trophy: the candidates for the award|work=Diario AS|date=2 December 2019|access-date=8 December 2019}}</ref> He won a third consecutive league title the following season, also winning the [[Serie A Awards|Serie A Best Goalkeeper Award]].

In April 2010, Brentford manager [[Andy Scott (footballer, born 1972)|Andy Scott]] said, "His performances suggest that he would not be out of place in the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] or even the Premier League. It has reached the stage where when he lets in a goal we wonder why he hasn't saved it."<ref name="plaudits"/> One year later, after Scott was sacked as Brentford manager, Szczęsny strongly criticized the club on [[Twitter]], and hoped that Scott would not be unemployed for long.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gunner Szczesny hot over Scott sacking|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/arsenal-keeper-wojciech-szczesny-blasted-3333242|publisher=Mirror Football|date=3 February 2011|access-date=15 April 2012}}</ref> In February 2015, Szczęsny was named as Brentford's "Keeper of the Decade" in a club poll.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.brentfordfc.co.uk/news/article/szczesny-michael-turner-jonathan-douglas-lloyd-owusu-brentford-2296164.aspx |title=Wojciech Szczesny, Michael Turner, Jonathan Douglas, Lloyd Owusu named in Brentford Team of Decade<!-- Bot generated title --> |website=brentfordfc.co.uk}}</ref>

==Style of play==
During his time with Arsenal, Szczęsny earned a reputation as a tall, promising, and talented goalkeeper, who possessed significant athleticism, as well as strong reflexes, agility, shot-stopping abilities, distribution, and a good mentality, but who was also inconsistent; as such, he occasionally came under criticism in the media over technical mistakes or errors in judgement, in particular on crosses, and for his lack of development during his time with the club,<ref name="Szczesny Signs New Contract">{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2875761-wojciech-szczesny-signs-new-contract-with-juventus-until-2024 |title=Wojciech Szczesny Signs New Contract with Juventus Until 2024 |publisher=Bleacher Report |last=Dudko |first=James |date=11 February 2020 |access-date=24 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/blog/name/93/post/1842571/headline |title=Szczesny an underrated part of Arsenal's season |publisher=ESPN|last=Mangan |first=Andrew |date=6 May 2014 |access-date=24 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1579700-5-reasons-wojciech-szczesny-is-arsenals-most-disappointing-player-this-season |title=5 Reasons Wojciech Szczesny Is Arsenal's Most Disappointing Player This Season |publisher=Bleacher Report |last1=Dudko |first1=James |date=25 March 2013 |access-date=24 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.gazzettadiparma.it/archivio/2013/11/16/news/wenger_conferma_szczesny-663671/ |title=Wenger conferma Szczesny |work=La Gazzetta di Parma |language=it |date=16 November 2013 |access-date=24 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1777571-10-world-football-goalkeepers-on-the-rise |title=10 World Football Goalkeepers on the Rise |publisher=Bleacher Report |last=Edwards |first=Daniel |date=18 September 2013 |access-date=18 June 2020 }}</ref> as well as his lack of discipline off the pitch, including an incident in which he was reportedly fined by the club after being caught smoking in the showers.<ref name="smoking"/><ref name="opens up"/>

Regarding Szczęsny's error–prone performances during his time in England, former Arsenal goalkeeper [[David Seaman]] commented in 2013 that the Polish keeper needed to become stronger mentally in order to retain his place in the first team.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.ibtimes.co.uk/arsenal-david-seaman-mental-toughness-wojciech-szczesny-453955 |title=Arsenal Stopper Should Look To United Star For Inspiration, Says Seaman |work=The International Business Times |last=Keller |first=Vanessa |date=5 April 2013 |access-date=24 April 2020 }}</ref> During his time in Italy, after producing a series of mixed performances during his first season with Roma, Szczęsny established himself as one of the best goalkeepers in Serie A during his second season with the team, and subsequently also maintained a consistently high level of performance with Juventus.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goal.com/it/notizie/futuro-alla-roma-incerto-per-szczesny-su-di-lui-juventus-e/kxe4edpi2y9a1t3jt2qwrubmb |title=Futuro alla Roma incerto per Szczesny: su di lui Juventus e Napoli |publisher=Goal.com |language=it |date=20 February 2017 |access-date=24 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://sport.sky.it/calciomercato/2018/05/23/migliori-portieri-serie-a-2017-2018 |title=Parate e "clean sheet": ecco i migliori portieri della Serie A |publisher=sport.sky.it |language=it |date=23 May 2018 |access-date=24 April 2020 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.calciomercato.com/news/juve-ecco-perche-szczesny-e-il-miglior-portiere-in-serie-a-54739 |title=Juve, ecco perché Szczesny è il miglior portiere in Serie A |publisher=Calciomercato |language=it |date=26 January 2020 |access-date=24 April 2020 }}</ref> In 2016, Szczęsny's former Arsenal manager Wenger labelled him a "world-class" goalkeeper.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.arsenal.com/news/features/20160218/-a-goalkeeper-is-always-focused- |title=A goalkeeper is always focused |publisher=Arsenal |last=Jones |first=Max |date=25 February 2016 |access-date=17 June 2020 }}</ref> Following his move to the Turin side in 2017, Szczęsny credited the manner in which the role of the goalkeeper is prepared and coached in Italy as one of the reasons for his drastic improvement, citing his Roma manager – Spalletti – and his goalkeeping coach with the club – Guido Nanni – as figures who played a key role in his development and maturation as a goalkeeper.<ref name="Szczesny leaves Arsenal" /><ref name="opens up" /><ref name="non avrò punti deboli">{{cite news |url=https://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/calcio-mercato/2017/07/19-28123150/szczesny_roma_grazie_ma_sono_felice_di_essere_alla_juventus/ |title=Szczesny: "Alla Juventus non avrò punti deboli" |work=Il Corriere dello Sport |language=it |date=19 July 2017 |access-date=24 April 2020 }}</ref>

In a 2017 interview with ''[[The Independent]]'', he commented that "the goalkeeping school in Italy is very different, it's very technical and pays more attention to the details", adding that "in the two-and-a-half years since I came to Italy, I've improved massively which is thanks to the coaches and the way they work. It's not about improving when you play, it's every day in training you have to work on every aspect of your game and that's something I've really enjoyed." Regarding the general approach to training in Italy, he stated: "the coaches in Italy are much more tactical".<ref name="opens up">{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/wojciech-szczesny-exclusive-interview-arsenal-smoking-juventus-gianluigi-buffon-retirement-a8002836.html |title=Wojciech Szczesny opens up on why he left Arsenal, smoking, Juventus and preparing to take Gigi Buffon's gloves |work=The Independent |last=Digby |first=Adam |date=16 October 2017 |access-date=24 April 2020 }}</ref> Upon his arrival at Juventus, his teammate Buffon named him as the best goalkeeper in Serie A during the previous season,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/serie-a/juve/2017/08/12-29154949/juventus_allegri_la_rabbia_di_cardiff_va_usata_per_affrontare_la_stagione |title=Juventus, Allegri: "La rabbia di Cardiff va usata per affrontare la stagione" |work=Il Corriere dello Sport |language=it |date=12 August 2017 |access-date=24 April 2020 }}</ref> while in October of that year, he described him as being "a younger and better goalkeeper" than himself.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.calciomercato.com/en/news/buffon-szczesny-better-than-me-higuain-97354 |title=Buffon: 'Szczesny better than me.

Szczęsny's former goalkeeping coach at Roma, Nanni, praised him in 2017 for his dedication in training, and for his ability to overcome his weaknesses and develop his all–round game, noting that he initially struggled to get to ground quickly to parry the ball and deal with low shots upon his arrival at the club, but that he improved significantly in this area under his tenure; he also lauded the keeper for his intelligence, cool demeanour, and calm composure in goal, as well as his ability with the ball at this feet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gianlucadimarzio.com/it/nanni-ex-preparatore-roma-szczesny-con-i-piedi-e-un-centrocampista-alla-pirlo |title=Nanni, ex preparatore Roma: "Szczesny?

During his career in England, his surname was often shortened as "'''Chesney'''" because of the difficult spelling of his family name, which is not common among English people. His name itself also caused problems for [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] supporters, and was often pronounced incorrectly, although he endeared himself to the Arsenal fans through his adopted London accent and down-to-earth attitude.{{cn|date=December 2022}} This trend continued even after he transferred to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/row-zed/wojciech-szczesny-spelling-arsenal-juventus-10845881|title=Ex-Arsenal keeper Wojciech Szczesny suffers embarrassing start at Juventus, as new club spell his name wrong|work=The Mirror|last1=Jones|first=Mark|date=21 July 2017|access-date=21 November 2019}}</ref> He is also known by the nickname "Tek."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.juventus.com/en/news/news/2019/happy-birthday-szczesny.php |title=Happy Birthday, Tek! |publisher=Juventus F.C. |date=18 April 2019 |access-date=25 April 2020 }}</ref>
