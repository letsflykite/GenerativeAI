For the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification]], there were two scheduled '''inter-confederation play-offs'''<ref group=note>The notation on FIFA's official website is "FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 intercontinental play-offs".</ref> to determine the final two qualification spots to the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]]. Matches were played on 13–14 June 2022 in Qatar.<ref name="Intercon Playoff">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/media-releases/draw-date-set-for-new-look-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022-tm-intercontinental|title=Draw date set for new-look FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 intercontinental play-offs|publisher=FIFA|date=19 November 2021}}</ref><ref name=Qatar />

==Format==
The draw for the inter-confederation play-offs was held on 26 November 2021, 17:00 [[Central European Time|CET]], in [[Zürich]], Switzerland.<ref name="Intercon Playoff" />

Four teams from four confederations ([[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]], [[CONCACAF]], [[CONMEBOL]], and [[Oceania Football Confederation|OFC]]) were drawn into two ties.

Originally, the two teams in each tie were to play a [[Two-legged tie|two-legged]] home-and-away series. However, the ties were single-leg knockout matches in Qatar.<ref name="Intercon Playoff" /><ref name=Qatar />

These play-offs were the last ties to decide the two remaining World Cup slots for a 32-team tournament. The [[2026 FIFA World Cup]] has been expanded to 48 teams, and included as part of the qualifiers a play-off tournament involving six teams to decide the last two berths.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y=2017/m=3/news=bureau-of-the-council-recommends-slot-allocation-for-the-2026-fifa-wor-2878254.html|title=Bureau of the Council recommends slot allocation for the 2026 FIFA World Cup|publisher=FIFA|date=30 March 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170409184031/http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/news/y%3D2017/m%3D3/news%3Dbureau-of-the-council-recommends-slot-allocation-for-the-2026-fifa-wor-2878254.html|archivedate=9 April 2017}}</ref>
