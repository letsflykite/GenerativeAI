On 15 March 2022, FIFA president [[Gianni Infantino]] met with Qatar Minister of Labor, [[Ali bin Samikh Al Marri]] in [[Doha]], and discussed the labor reforms taking place in the country.<ref>{{Cite web |title=FIFA President and Qatar Minister of Labour meet to discuss progress of labour rights |url=https://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/president/media-releases/origin1904-p.cxm.fifa.comfifa-president-and-qatar-minister-of-labour-meet-to-discuss-progress-of |access-date=2022-04-07 |website=www.fifa.com |language=en}}</ref> On 16 March 2022 Infantino said in an interview, “I am pleased to see the strong commitment from the Qatari authorities to ensure the reforms are fully implemented across the labor market, leaving a lasting legacy of the FIFA World Cup long after the event, and benefiting migrant workers in the host country in the long term.”<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-03-16 |title=FIFA chief Infantino lauds Qatar's labour reforms |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/fifa-world-cup/story/4617958/fifa-president-gianni-infantino-lauds-qatars-labour-reforms |access-date=2022-04-07 |website=ESPN.com |language=en}}</ref> 

On November 1, 2022, the [[International Labour Organization|International Labor Organization]] (ILO) recognized that Qatar has “undertaken comprehensive labor reforms to improve the conditions of the hundreds of thousands of migrant workers” which have “yielded benefits for workers, employers, and the economy more broadly.” This builds upon their 2021 report that detailed the positive impact of Qatar’s new labor legislation and implementation mechanisms. Also, On November 23, 2022, [[Foreign Policy]] (an American media house) drafted a report on the latest acknowledgement of the labor reforms that Qatar initiated, as the nation has already been scrutinized for its treatment of migrant workers in the past. Reforms include the introduction of a nondiscriminatory minimum wage, the removal of barriers to change jobs, and the introduction of a worker compensation fund in 2018 that has paid out $350 million so far.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Ali Al Ansari |first=Ali Al Ansari |date=23 November 2022 |title=Don't ignore labour reforms of qatar |work=Foreign Policy |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/11/23/dont-ignore-qatars-progress-on-labor/}}</ref>
