He is widely regarded as one of the greatest defenders of his generation.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/2466/goal-50/2016/11/10/28456642/pepe-named-as-worlds-best-defender-of-2016 |title=Pepe named as world's best defender of 2016 |website=Goal.com |date=10 November 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2019/12/26/7-best-centre-backs-of-the-decade/|title=7 Best Centre-Backs of the Decade|date=26 December 2019 | website=HITC}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url= https://the18.com/en/soccer-entertainment/is-pepe-most-underrated-defender-ever|title=Pepe: The Most Underrated Defender Of All Time?}}</ref>

During his professional career, Pepe played for [[C.S. Marítimo|Marítimo]], [[FC Porto|Porto]], [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]], and [[Beşiktaş J.K.|Beşiktaş]], with individual and team success with the middle two clubs. He won three [[La Liga]] titles, three [[UEFA Champions League]] titles, two [[Copa del Rey]] titles and played 334 games for Real Madrid.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Lowe|first1=Sid|title=Pepe leaves Real Madrid a touch bitter but with inner Hannibal Lecter tamed {{!}} Sid Lowe|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2017/jun/07/pepe-real-madrid-hannibal-lecter|website=The Guardian|date=7 June 2017}}</ref> He has also won four [[Primeira Liga]] titles and three [[Taça de Portugal]] titles with Porto.

Born and raised in Brazil, Pepe opted to play for the Portugal national team, and has earned [[List of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps|134 caps]] since his debut in 2007. He played at four [[FIFA World Cup]]s and as many [[UEFA European Championship]]s, and was part of the team that won [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]], also reaching the semi-finals of [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]]. Pepe was man of the match in the Euro 2016 final.

==Club career==
===Marítimo===
Born in [[Maceió]], [[Alagoas]], Pepe was named Kepler Laveran by his father in honour to scientists [[Johannes Kepler]] and [[Charles Louis Alphonse Laveran]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://torcedores.uol.com.br/noticias/2015/11/historias-do-zagueiro-pepe-contadas-por-seu-pai|title=Conheça histórias do zagueiro Pepe, contadas por seu pai|trans-title=Get to know stories of the defender Pepe, told by his father|publisher=UOL|language=pt|access-date=18 June 2017|archive-date=31 July 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731050433/http://torcedores.uol.com.br/noticias/2015/11/historias-do-zagueiro-pepe-contadas-por-seu-pai|url-status=dead}}</ref> He started playing football with local [[Sport Club Corinthians Alagoano|Corinthians Alagoano]]. At age 18, alongside teammate [[Ezequias]], he moved to Portugal to sign with [[C.S. Marítimo|Marítimo]] in [[Madeira]], spending the vast majority of his first season with the [[C.S. Marítimo B|B-team]].

After being promoted to the main squad for the [[2002–03 Primeira Liga|2002–03 season]], under Russian manager [[Anatoliy Byshovets]], Pepe rarely missed a match, playing in several positions including [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]].{{citation needed|date=December 2020}}

During the [[2002–03 Primeira Liga|2002–03 pre-season]], Pepe was given permission to train with [[Sporting CP]] for two weeks, after which a deal could be negotiated for his transfer. However, neither club could agree on financial terms and the negotiations broke down, with the player returning<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tsf.pt/PaginaInicial/Interior.aspx?content_id=737123|title=Pepe regressa ao Marítimo|trans-title=Pepe returns to Marítimo|publisher=[[TSF (radio station)|TSF]]|language=pt|date=23 July 2002|access-date=15 May 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529103601/http://www.tsf.pt/PaginaInicial/Interior.aspx?content_id=737123|archive-date=29 May 2014}}</ref> and going on to help Marítimo finish sixth in the [[2003–04 Primeira Liga|following campaign]] and qualify to the [[2004–05 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]], having contributed with 1 goal in 30 matches.

===Porto===
[[File:Pepe Porto.jpg|thumb|left|Pepe playing for [[FC Porto|Porto]] in 2006]]
In May 2004, shortly before the club sealed a [[Treble (association football)|treble]] of the league, cup and [[UEFA Champions League]], Pepe signed for [[FC Porto|Porto]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Pepe já assinou contrato|trans-title=Pepe already signed a contract|url=https://www.record.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-nos/fc-porto/detalhe/pepe-ja-assinou-contrato |access-date=24 December 2020 |work=Record |date=13 May 2004 |language=pt}}</ref>

In [[2004–05 Primeira Liga|his first season]], with Spanish coach [[Víctor Fernández]] at the helm, Pepe was mostly used as a backup player, playing under veterans [[Pedro Emanuel]], [[Jorge Costa (footballer)|Jorge Costa]] and utility defender [[Ricardo Costa (footballer, born 1981)|Ricardo Costa]]. However, in [[2005–06 Primeira Liga|the following year]], under the guidance of [[Co Adriaanse]], he had a breakthrough season, establishing himself as one of the best defenders in the domestic competition: the Dutchman often chose a [[Formation (association football)|3–4–3 offensive system]], with the player often pitched as the only natural stopper.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} Porto eventually won back-to-back leagues and the [[2005–06 Taça de Portugal|Taça de Portugal]].

===Real Madrid===
====2007–11 seasons====
On 10 July 2007, [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] signed Pepe to a five-year contract, paying Porto a €30&nbsp;million transfer fee.<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=559801.html Madrid pick up Pepe from Porto]; UEFA.com, 10 July 2007</ref> On 15 March 2008, Pepe scored the only ([[Own goal|own]]) goal in a 0–1 away loss against [[Deportivo de La Coruña|Deportivo La Coruña]].<ref>[https://int.soccerway.com/news/2008/march/15/deportivo-curse-strikes-again-for-real/ Deportivo curse strikes again for Real]; Soccerway, 15 March 2008</ref> Eight months later, he was involved in a fight during training with teammate [[Javier Balboa]]<ref>[http://www.marca.com/edicion/marca/futbol/1a_division/real_madrid/es/desarrollo/1056064.html Balboa y Pepe se pelean durante el entrenamiento (Balboa and Pepe fight during training)]; [[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]], 9 November 2007 {{in lang|es}}</ref>&nbsp;– the defender was nonetheless called up for Real's next match, whereas the [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] was not. As ''Los Blancos'' were eventually [[2007–08 La Liga|crowned champions]] of [[La Liga]], he delivered a [[Man of the match]] performance in a 1–0 win at the [[Camp Nou]] against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]].<ref>[http://www.diariocritico.com/2007/Diciembre/deporte/futbol/51678/barna-madrid-diciembre-07.html Navidades blancas: el Real Madrid apuntilla al Barça (0–1) (White Christmas: Real Madrid kills Barça (0–1))]; Diario Crítico, 23 December 2007 {{in lang|es}}</ref>

Pepe was constantly hampered by injuries throughout the [[2008–09 La Liga|2008–09 campaign]]. On 21 April 2009, he was also involved in an incident with [[Getafe CF|Getafe]]'s [[Javier Casquero]]: with the score at 2–2 and only a few minutes to play, he brought down the midfielder in the [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalty area]], being subsequently [[Ejection (sports)|sent off]]. He then kicked Casquero twice, once on his shin and once on his lower back. When being pulled away from Casquero, he also pushed his head into the turf and stamped on him several times. In the ensuing mêlée, he also struck another opposing player, [[Juan Ángel Albín]], in the face and eventually received a ten-match ban, which effectively ended his season.<ref>[http://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/2009/04/24/pepe_ban/ Pepe receives 10-game ban]; Sportsnet, 24 April 2009</ref>

[[File:Pepe y aguero.jpg|thumb|255px|Pepe chasing down [[Sergio Agüero]] of [[Atlético Madrid]] in 2010]]
In the [[2009–10 La Liga|2009–10 season]], Pepe returned to claim his place back in the starting line-ups. On 4 October 2009, he scored his first goal in the league, against [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] at the [[Ramón Sánchez Pizjuán Stadium]], heading home from a [[Guti (Spanish footballer)|Guti]] [[Indirect free kick|free-kick]] in a 1–2 loss. However, on 12 December, during a match at [[Mestalla Stadium|Mestalla]] against [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] (3–2 win), he landed awkwardly following an aerial challenge and was stretchered off the pitch in the dying minutes of the first half. Scans later showed that he ruptured his right knee's [[anterior cruciate ligament]].<ref>[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/european/6803182/Injury-blow-for-Real-Madrid-defender-Pepe.html Injury blow for Real Madrid defender Pepe]; ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 13 December 2009</ref> He went on to miss the rest of the season, jeopardising his [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] chances.

For [[2010–11 La Liga|2010–11]], Pepe was joined at Real Madrid by countrymen [[Ricardo Carvalho]] and manager [[José Mourinho]], pairing up with Carvalho to form one of the most efficient defensive pairings in La Liga. On 2 October 2010, ''[[Diario AS]]'' published an article where the player was reportedly open to leave the club on a [[Bosman ruling|Bosman transfer]].<ref>[http://www.as.com/futbol/articulo/pepe-dispuesto-irse-libre-2012/dasftb/20101002dasdaiftb_16/Tes Pepe está dispuesto a irse libre en 2012 Pepe está dispuesto a irse libre en 2012 (Pepe willing to leave for free in 2012)]; [[Diario AS]], 2 October 2010 {{in lang|es}}</ref> According to the newspaper, "[W]hen he signed for Real Madrid in 2007, he sacrificed a part of his salary to pay for his huge transfer fee&nbsp;– this made him one of the lowest earners at the club, making €1.8&nbsp;million a year."<ref>[http://www.soccernews.com/pepe-nearing-real-madrid-exit/62409/ Pepe nearing Real Madrid exit]; Soccer News, 2 October 2010</ref> Again, he missed several matches due to injury<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2011-01-07-907409531_x.htm Madrid defender Pepe ruled out with calf injury]; [[USA Today]], 7 January 2011</ref> and, after exhausting negotiations,<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/897116/madrid-confident-of-agreeing-new-deal-with-pepe?cc=5739 Madrid hopeful over Pepe deal]; [[ESPN Soccernet]], 21 March 2011</ref> finally signed a new contract, renewing his link to the club until 2015.<ref>[http://www.goal.com/en/news/12/spain/2011/03/21/2404821/pepe-signs-2015-real-madrid-contract-extension-report Pepe signs 2015 Real Madrid contract extension]; Goal.com, 21 March 2011</ref>

Pepe spent the final stretch of the season appearing as a defensive midfielder as Real Madrid faced Barcelona four times in less than one month. On 27 April 2011, in the [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League semi-final first leg]], he was sent off for a controversial challenge on Barcelona defender [[Dani Alves]] in an eventual 0–2 home loss.<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/matches/season=2011/round=2000121/match=2007742/postmatch/report/index.html#ten+madrid+undone+messi+magic Ten-man Madrid undone by Messi magic]; UEFA.com, 27 April 2011</ref> However, Alves also came into strong criticism, with Real Madrid claiming the Brazilian fullback had exaggerated the incident. Additionally, sportspersons including [[Rio Ferdinand]], [[Michael Owen]] and [[Rory McIlroy]] criticised Alves' actions.<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/912900/real-madrid-release-?cc=4716 Real release "proof" of Alves dive]; ESPN Soccernet, 28 April 2011</ref> The next day, [[UEFA]] opened disciplinary cases against both clubs for a number of incidents during the match.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/footballfirst/matchorganisation/disciplinary/news/newsid=1624556.html|title=Disciplinary cases opened against Real Madrid and Barcelona|publisher=UEFA.com|date=28 April 2011|access-date=24 January 2012}}</ref> The verdict was announced eight days later: the red card stood and Pepe therefore received a one-match ban from European competition, which he served by not playing in the 1–1 draw in the second leg at [[Camp Nou]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefa/footballfirst/matchorganisation/disciplinary/news/newsid=1628218.html |title=Sanctions for Madrid and Barcelona |publisher=UEFA.com |date=6 May 2011 |access-date=24 January 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722010126/http://www.uefa.com/uefa/footballfirst/matchorganisation/disciplinary/news/newsid%3D1628218.html |archive-date=22 July 2011 }}</ref>

On 21 March 2012, Pepe was involved in another serious incident: after a 1–1 away draw against [[Villarreal CF|Villarreal]] in which he was [[Penalty card#Yellow card|booked]] and Real Madrid finished with nine players, he confronted [[Referee (association football)|referee]] José Luis Paradas Romero in the locker room area, saying, "What a ripoff motherfucker."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.marca.com/2012/03/22/futbol/equipos/real_madrid/1332373831.html|title=Vaya atraco, hijo de puta|trans-title=What a ripoff motherfucker|publisher=Marca|date=22 March 2012|access-date=23 March 2012}}</ref> Two days later, he was suspended for two matches.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/1039491/real-madrid-defender-pepe-handed-two-match-la-liga-ban?cc=5739|title=Pepe handed two-match ban|publisher=ESPN Soccernet|date=23 March 2012|access-date=23 March 2012}}</ref>

In the 2011–12 season, Pepe formed a formidable centre back partnership with [[Sergio Ramos]].

==International career==
===Naturalisation, Euro 2008 and 2010 World Cup===
[[File:Pepe Euro 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Pepe with [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in 2012]]
Pepe never represented his native [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in any youth category. However, according to the player's father, in 2006, he was contacted by head coach [[Dunga]] about a possible call-up which he declined, stating that once he obtained Portuguese citizenship, he would join [[Portugal national football team|its national team]].<ref>[http://www.cmjornal.xl.pt/noticia.aspx?contentid=8FE36ADC-C55E-4619-BA09-279701390D5D&channelid=91CFF08C-5AFF-40CB-9986-5952BA51499C "Pepe esteve exemplar" ("Pepe was perfect")]; Correio da Manhã, 9 June 2008 {{in lang|pt}}</ref> He became naturalised in August 2007 and, on 30 August, was named in the Portugal squad for the first time in view of a [[UEFA Euro 2008]] [[UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying|qualifier]] against [[Poland national football team|Poland]].<ref>[http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=458492&cc=5739 Portugal name Pepe in Euro 2008 qualifiers squad]; ESPN Soccernet, 30 August 2007</ref> An injury while training for his club prevented the debut for his adopted country, which would materialise almost four months later, in Portugal's last match in the tournament against [[Finland national football team|Finland]] on 21 November, a 0–0 home draw.

In the tournament's final stages, Pepe played in all of the national side's matches, scoring once in a 2–0 win against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] on 7 June 2008.<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=708572.html Pepe joy in Geneva]; UEFA.com, 8 June 2008</ref> Portugal was eliminated in the quarter-finals by [[Germany national football team|Germany]].

During the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifying campaign]], Pepe was often used as a defensive midfielder by national coach [[Carlos Queiroz]]. After his serious knee injury while playing for Real Madrid, he was eventually selected for the national squad that participated in the finals in South Africa, appearing against Brazil in the group stage (0–0) and eventual champions [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in the [[Single-elimination tournament|round of 16]] (0–1 loss).

===Euro 2012 and 2014 World Cup===
Again a starter in [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] under manager [[Paulo Bento]], Pepe opened the score in the second group game against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], heading home after a [[João Moutinho]] [[corner kick]] in an eventual 3–2 win.<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/matches/round=15172/match=2003330/postmatch/report/index.html Last-gasp Varela revives Portugal's hopes]; UEFA.com, 13 June 2012</ref> He was later chosen by [[UEFA]] as man of the match<ref>[http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/man-of-the-match-award/md=2/match=2003330/index.html Pepe does it again for Portugal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615224612/http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season%3D2012/man-of-the-match-award/md%3D2/match%3D2003330/index.html |date=15 June 2012 }}; UEFA.com, 13 June 2012</ref> and, in the semi-final, he was one of two Portugal players to score in a 2–4 [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] defeat to eventual winners Spain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/season=2012/matches/round=15174/match=2003378/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Spain survive test of nerve to reach final|publisher=UEFA|work=UEFA.com|date=27 June 2012|access-date=18 June 2014}}</ref>

In the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]], Pepe received a red card in the first half of Portugal's opening match against eventual champions Germany, for headbutting [[Thomas Müller]] late into the first half of an eventual 0–4 loss.

===2018 World Cup and Euro 2020===
In Portugal's opening match against Spain during the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]], Pepe went down after a collision with Spain forward [[Diego Costa]], who then took the ball into the penalty area before scoring. The goal was checked by the [[video assistant referee]] (VAR), who allowed the goal to stand. In Portugal's second match, Pepe went down after he was tapped on the back by Morocco's [[Medhi Benatia]]. In the BBC studio, former footballer [[Rio Ferdinand]] called Pepe's dive "embarrassing".<ref name="dive"/> Former striker [[Didier Drogba]] also expressed derision for Pepe, stating "he's been doing this quite a few times".<ref name="dive"/> Pepe scored in Portugal's [[2018 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Uruguay vs Portugal|2–1]] defeat against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in the last 16.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/match/300331544/#match-summary|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180628233958/https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/matches/match/300331544/#match-summary|url-status=dead|archive-date=28 June 2018|title=Cavani fires La Celeste past European champions|date=30 June 2018|work=FIFA.com}}</ref>

==Style of play==
A quick, aggressive, physically strong, and tenacious defender, Pepe is known for his work-rate and hard-tackling style of play; due to his height, he is also an aerial threat on [[Set piece (football)|set-pieces]]. While he usually plays as a [[centre-back]], he has also been used as a [[defensive midfielder]] at international level. However, despite his defensive abilities, he has also drawn criticism in the media due to his tendency to pick up cards, as he has often shown violent or unsportsmanlike behaviour, which includes [[Simulation (Association football)|diving]],<ref name="dive">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44553190|title=That's embarrassing!
