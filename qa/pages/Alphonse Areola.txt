He returned to PSG in 2016, where he went on to make over 100 appearances. In 2019, Areola joined [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] on a season-long loan. In 2020, he joined [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on loan; he followed up with another loan to West Ham United in 2021. In June 2022, Areola joined West Ham for a fee in the region of €12 million.

Areola has represented France at every youth level and was part of the squads that won the [[2013 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] and the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

====Early career====
[[File:Alphonse Areola (RC Lens).JPG|thumb|upright|Areola playing for [[RC Lens|Lens]] in 2014]]

Areola began playing football at the age of six for Entente Sportive des Petits Anges and spent seven years at his local club before signing for [[Ligue 1]] side [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] (PSG). When Areola was 15, and upon the advice of coaches in Paris, he enrolled at the [[INF Clairefontaine|Clairefontaine]] football centre in order to further his development. He returned to PSG the following year and signed his first professional contract with the Parisians in July 2009, putting pen to paper on a three-year deal.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.africatopsports.com/2013/07/11/alphonse-areola-la-biographie/ |title=Alphonse Areola: La Biographie |website=Africa Top Sports |date=11 July 2013 |access-date=12 November 2016}}{{in lang|fr}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.psg.fr/fr/Article/003001/Article/45531/Premier-contrat-pro-pour-Areola |title=Premier Contrat Pro Pour Areola |website=Paris Saint-Germain Football Club |date=3 July 2016 |access-date=13 December 2016 |archive-date=3 March 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303183736/http://www.psg.fr/fr/Article/003001/Article/45531/Premier-contrat-pro-pour-Areola |url-status=dead }}{{in lang|fr}}</ref>

On 18 May 2013, having progressed through the club's academy, Areola made his senior debut for PSG, replacing first-choice goalkeeper [[Salvatore Sirigu]] in the 48th minute of a 3–1 home win over [[Stade Brestois 29|Brest]]. PSG had been crowned Ligue 1 champions prior to the match and their opponents were already relegated.<ref name=Sky>{{cite news |title=Beckham delivers in Paris win |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/260101/report |access-date=30 November 2014 |website=Sky Sports News |date=18 May 2013}}</ref> He made his first start for the club the following weekend in a 3–1 win over [[FC Lorient|Lorient]], playing 61 minutes in what was the final match of the season before being [[Substitute (association football)|substituted]] for fourth-choice 'keeper [[Ronan Le Crom]], who was sent off later in the match for a foul on [[Julien Quercia]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Lorient 1–3 Paris Saint-Germain: Gameiro at the double but Sakho in goal as champions' season finishes in farce |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/match/lorient-vs-psg/1286387/report |access-date=30 November 2014 |website=Goal |date=23 May 2013 |last=Ali |first=Mohammed}}</ref>

==International career==
[[File:Alphonse Aréola.jpg|thumb|250px|Areola playing for [[France national under-19 football team|France under-19s]]]]

Areola has played for France at all youth levels.
