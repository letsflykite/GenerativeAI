==Style of play==
Rodri is a physically strong and tall player. His physique helps him to frequently win tackles, challenges on opponent players, as well as aerial duels. He has a 73% success rate at tackles on opponent players,<ref name=":0">{{Cite web |title=Infogol |url=https://www.infogol.net/en/player/rodri/2279 |access-date=19 May 2023 |website=www.infogol.net}}</ref> and has won 100% of his aerial duels in the 2022–23 season, according to Squawka. He averages a passing accuracy of 91–92%.<ref name=":0" /> 

In his Manchester City tenure, he is also known for his long shots leading to goals.{{citation needed|date=June 2023}} Despite not being particularly renowned for his pace, he has been credited by pundits for his ability to catch up with much faster attackers in midfield.<ref>{{Cite web |date=29 April 2022 |title=Rodri: 3 characteristics of the Manchester City player |url=https://mbpschool.com/en/rodri-manchester-city-fundamentals/ |access-date=19 May 2023 |website=mbpschool.com |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Lee |first=Sam |title=Can head, can pass … can foul: why Rodri has earned unique praise from Guardiola |url=https://theathletic.com/1129727/2019/08/12/can-head-can-pass-can-foul-why-rodri-has-earned-unique-praise-from-guardiola/ |access-date=19 May 2023 |website=The Athletic |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=15 April 2023 |title='He understands perfectly': Pep Guardiola sets Rodri challenge |url=https://www.manchestercity.news/man-city-rodri-pep-guardiola/ |access-date=19 May 2023 |website=Manchester City News |language=en-GB}}</ref> Many pundits consider him as one of the best current defensive midfielders in world football.<ref>{{Cite web |date=19 May 2023 |title=Arsenal star Partey told he 'can't lace Rodri's boots' as pundit makes huge U-turn |url=https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/arsenal-star-partey-told-t-090117382.html |access-date=19 May 2023 |website=Yahoo!

Besides his regular position of a [[holding midfielder]], he has occasionally been used as a ball-playing [[centre back]], in particular by national team manager [[Luis Enrique]] during the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/30/spain-creative-decision-rodri-defence-paying-off-luis-enrique-world-cup | title=Spain's creative decision to play Rodri in defence is paying off at World Cup | newspaper=The Guardian | date=30 November 2022 | last1=McAleer | first1=Ben }}</ref>
