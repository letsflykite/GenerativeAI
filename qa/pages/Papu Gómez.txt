'''Alejandro Darío Gómez''' ({{IPA-es|aleˈxandɾo ðaˈɾi.o ˈɣomes}};{{efn-lg|In isolation, ''Darío'' and ''Gómez'' are pronounced {{IPA-es|daˈɾi.o|}} and {{IPA-es|ˈɡomes|}} respectively.}} born 15 February 1988), known as '''Papu Gómez''', is an Argentine professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]], [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] or [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] for [[La Liga]] club [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] and the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina national team]].

Gómez started his club career in his home country with [[Arsenal de Sarandí]] in 2005, before joining [[San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]] in 2009. The following year, he was signed by Italian club [[Calcio Catania|Catania]]. In 2013, he joined Ukrainian side [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist Kharkiv]], where he remained for a single season, before returning to Italy to play for [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]]. In [[2019–20 Serie A|2019–20]], Gómez set the [[Serie A]] record for most [[Assist (association football)|assists]] in a single season with sixteen, and was named to the [[Serie A Team of the Year]].

Although he was born in Argentina, Gómez is a dual citizen of Argentina and Italy, having gained Italian citizenship on 14 May 2016.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |last=Football Italia staff |date=14 May 2016 |title=Papu Gomez available for Italy |url=http://www.football-italia.net/84318/papu-gomez-available-italy |access-date=17 November 2016 |website=Football Italia|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160618021453/https://football-italia.net/84318/papu-gomez-available-italy|archive-date=18 June 2016}}</ref> He made his senior international debut for Argentina in a friendly against [[Singapore national football team|Singapore]] in 2017, during which he also scored his first international goal. He later took part in Argentina's victorious [[2021 Copa América]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] campaigns.

==Club career==
===Arsenal de Sarandí===
Gómez began his career playing with the youth squad of Argentine side [[Arsenal de Sarandí]], debuting for the team in 2003. Two years later, he was officially called up to the first team, but did not feature as a regular with the side until the [[2006–07 Argentine Primera División|2006 Torneo Apertura]], during which he scored 2 goals in 15 appearances, as Arsenal finished the season in 5th place.

On 30 November 2007, Gómez scored the 2 most important goals up to that point of his career in the first leg of the [[2007 Copa Sudamericana Finals|Copa Sudamericana Finals]], away against favourites [[Club América]] of [[Liga MX]], giving Arsenal a valuable 3–2 lead going into the second leg.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-30779420071201|title=Arsenal stun America in Sudamericana|last=Romero|first=Henry|date=6 December 2007|website=REUTERS|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref> On 5 December, Arsenal lost the return leg 2–1, but won their first international title on the [[away goals rule]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/soccer-latam-sudamericana-idUKSP13602620071206|title=Soccer-Argentina's Arsenal win Sudamericana to claim first title|last=Homewood|first=Brian|date=6 December 2007|publisher=REUTERS|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref>

The [[2008–09 Argentine Primera División season|2008–09 season]] was his breakout season, as he scored 8 goals in 18 appearances and got into the top scoring charts with braces against [[Club Atlético Independiente|Independiente]] and [[Club Atlético Vélez Sarsfield|Velez Sarsfield]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=19 October 2008|title=Arsenal de Sarandí 3-3 Vélez Sarsfield :: Apertura 2008/09|url=https://www.ceroacero.es/match.php?id=468171|access-date=8 February 2022|website=CeroaCero|language=es}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=14 December 2008|title=Independiente vs. Arsenal 1-2|url=https://us.soccerway.com/matches/2008/12/14/argentina/primera-division/ca-independiente/arsenal-de-sarandi/647115/|access-date=8 February 2022|website=Soccerway.com}}</ref>

===San Lorenzo===
[[San Lorenzo de Almagro]] signed Gómez for a 2 million dollar transfer fee, half of his estimated market value, in time for the [[2009–10 Argentine Primera División season|2009]] [[Apertura and Clausura in Argentine football|Clausura tournament]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.diario26.com/82975--papu-gomez-el-nuevo-refuerzo-de-san-lorenzo|title="Papu" Gómez, el nuevo refuerzo de San Lorenzo|date=3 February 2009|publisher=Diario26|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref> His impressive play, including netting 8 times in 48 appearances for ''Los Santos'', attracted the attention of several high-profile scouts. This led to his transfer to Italian [[Serie A]] [[Calcio Catania|Catania]] in July 2010, for €3 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Calciomercato/21-07-2010/inter-ranocchia-ora-ufficiale-71519845802.shtml|title=Inter-Ranocchia: ufficiale Zuculini è del Genoa|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=it|date=21 July 2010|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref>

===Catania===
Catania officially welcomed their new 22-year-old signing on 21 July 2010, and he made his first appearance with the club 9 days later in a 1–0 friendly win against [[Super League Greece|Greek]] side [[Iraklis 1908 Thessaloniki F.C.|Iraklis]]. Gómez was immediately inserted into the starting XI and soon became integral to his club's record-breaking renaissance over the next 3 seasons.

''El Papu'' contributed 4 goals and 5 assists in each of his first 2 seasons. His breakthrough campaign came during the [[2012–13 Serie A|2012–13 season]], when his [[Playmaker|playmaking]] and offensive prowess became the main catalyst of the team, propelling his side to club record highs for home and overall victories, and, for their 5th successive year, points.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=http://forzaitalianfootball.com/2013/11/catania-club-focus-rossazzurri-not-missing-lodi-as-much-as-papu/|title=Catania Club Focus: Rossazzurri not missing Lodi as much as Papu|last=Galindo|first=Peter|date=28 November 2013|publisher=Forza Italian Football|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref> The ''Rossazzurri'' clinched an eighth-place finish in Serie A, equaling their historic best placement in the league for the first time since the [[1964–65 Serie A|1964–65]] season, but 5 points shy of earning their inaugural appearance in the [[UEFA]] [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]]. The side that managed to achieve these record-breaking achievements was described as the best Catania side in the club's history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.calciocatania.it/page.php?page=storia&l=en|title=Calcio Catania: La Storia|publisher=Calcio Catania|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref> Gómez finished the year with a career high 8 goals in 36 appearances, making him the second highest on the team behind [[Gonzalo Bergessio]], as well as 7 assists, making him the club's joint highest assist provider, and the tenth best provider in Serie A.<ref name=":0" />

Catania, for reasons that were never clarified, sold Gómez during the summer and replaced him with the injury-prone and inconsistent [[Sebastián Leto]], whom they acquired on a free transfer from [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://forzaitalianfootball.com/2014/05/top-10-worst-players-in-serie-a-201314/|title=Top 10 Worst Players in Serie A 2013/14|last=Galindo|first=Peter|date=22 May 2014|publisher=Forza Italian Football|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref> Despite having four of their top six offensive players return, and later five of their six when [[Francesco Lodi]] was reacquired on loan from [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]] in January, Catania's performances declined heavily, which saw them fall to 18th position in the league, and as a result, they were ultimately relegated.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/43342/lodi-back-catania|title=Lodi back at Catania|publisher=Football Italia|author=Football Italia staff|date=3 January 2014|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref>

===Metalist Kharkiv===
[[File:Alejandro Darío Gómez.jpg|160px|thumb|Gómez with Metalist in 2013]]

Rebuffing offers from several big clubs, including [[Atlético Madrid|Atletico Madrid]], [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], and [[Inter Milan]], Gómez himself requested a transfer to little-known [[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Metalist Kharkiv]] of the [[Ukrainian Premier League]], citing the Club's commitment to growth and the opportunity to play in the upcoming [[UEFA Champions League]] as his reasons.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/metalist-kharkiv-signing-alejandro-gomez-i-turned-down-inter-milan-fiorentina-3972542|title=Alejandro Gomez: I turned down Inter Milan, Fiorentina|last=Tribal Football Staff|date=3 August 2013|publisher=Tribal Football|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref> On 2 August 2013, he signed four-year contract with the club, which included a €12 million release clause, following a €7 million transfer fee.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://forzaitalianfootball.com/2013/08/gomez-leaves-catania-for-metalist/|title=Gomez leaves Catania for Metalist|publisher=Forza Italian Football|last=Ross|first=Ryan|date=2 August 2013|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref> However, things did not go well for him with the side from the beginning.

UEFA upheld Metalist's ban from the Champions League two weeks later because of the club's involvement in match fixing in 2008.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/23695964|title=Metalist Kharkiv remain banned from Champions League|publisher=BBC|access-date=17 November 2016|date=16 August 2013}}</ref> By the December winter break, failing to settle into his new surroundings due to a combination of the league's lack of visibility and quality, which he believed made playing in it a waste of time, as well as adverse environmental and linguistic issues in [[Ukraine]] itself, which he saw as insurmountable, Gómez wanted out of his contract. He therefore requested a transfer back to Serie A as soon as possible, preferably to Fiorentina, and by January 2014, offered to accept a salary reduction in order to have this accomplished.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11866/9082279/transfer-news-metalist-kharkiv-winger-alejandro-gomez-keen-to-join-fiorentina|title=Transfer News: Metalist Kharkiv winger Alejandro Gomez keen to join Fiorentina|publisher=Sky Sports|last=Bargellini|first=Simone|date=13 December 2013|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref> This request went unfilled, however, and he ultimately played in 23 games, scoring 3 goals and setting up 4 others, helping the ''[[FC Metalist Kharkiv|Hor'ky]]'' finish 3rd overall.

Gómez refused to return to Ukraine the following season because of the volatile and violent political climate that emerged during his time there. He stated "It's an anguished situation, very unstable, as we are all sad and living in a state of panic...I have no intention of coming back...I will stay in [[Buenos Aires]]...Until there can be guarantees of safety, I cannot expose my family to these dangers."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/52470/gomez-refuses-ukraine-return/|title=Gomez refuses Ukraine return|publisher=Football Italia|author=Football Italia staff|date=22 July 2014|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref> Many players, especially foreign ones, also left the league for this same reason, including three of Gomez's teammates, and six from reigning league Champions [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/la-sp-soccer-baxter-20141012-story.html|title=Ongoing conflict in Ukraine wreaks havoc on country's Premier League|publisher=The L.A.

===Atalanta===
[[File:Papu Gomez 01.JPG|160px|thumb|left|Gómez with Atalanta in 2014]]

Following [[Giacomo Bonaventura]]'s departure to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] on 1 September 2014, [[Atalanta B.C.|Atalanta]] acquired Gómez on the same day, signing him on a three-year deal in the last hours of the summer transfer window in Italy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/55368/official-papu-gomez-atalanta/|title=Official: Papu Gomez to Atalanta|publisher=Football Italia|author=Football Italia staff|date=1 September 2014|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref> Gómez had a decent first season, contributing 3 goals and 2 assists in 24 appearances to a poor, offensively-challenged ''Nerazzurri'' squad that struggled and narrowly avoided relegation, finishing fourth from the bottom, 3 points ahead of [[Serie B]]-bound [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]].

The following season, Gómez lead his club in both goals and assists, with 7 and 6 respectively, as he rekindled the form he had shown in his final season at Catania, and, despite the continued lack of attacking support, steered Atalanta to a respectable 13th-place finish in the league.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/SerieA/season/2015-16/Review/Serie-A-Team-of-the-Season|title=Serie A Team of the Season 2015–16|publisher=Football Italia|last=Dalmonte|first=Edo|access-date=17 November 2016}}</ref> His performances spurred the interest of several big clubs, which pushed the Bergamese side to extend his contract until June 2020, on 4 February 2016.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.transfermarketweb.com/?action=read&idsel=167325/|title=ITALY/ OFFICIAL, Papu Gomez renews for Atalanta|publisher=TRANSFERmarketWEB|last=Colla|first=Claudio|date=4 February 2016|access-date=17 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170214031707/http://www.transfermarketweb.com/?action=read|archive-date=14 February 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref>

During the [[2016–17 Atalanta B.C. season|2016–17]] season, Gómez managed to score an unprecedented total of 16 goals as his team finished in the fourth place contrary to the lower pre-season expectations. In 2017, following the departure and retirement of [[Cristian Raimondi]], he became the team's captain.

As captain, Gómez helped lead Atalanta to a historic third-place finish in the [[2018–19 Atalanta B.C. season|2018–19]] [[2018–19 Serie A|Serie A]] season, earning a spot in the [[2019–20 UEFA Champions League|2019–20 UEFA Champions]] League, as well as reaching the [[2019 Coppa Italia Final]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/atalantas-ronaldo-papu-gomez-leads-out-europes-biggest/17vlr046wydh91gmabnhr3l1tj |title=Atalanta in Champions League: The fairytale story of Europe's biggest overachievers, led by Papu Gomez |publisher=www.goal.com |last1=Doyle |first1=Mark |date=16 February 2020 |access-date=3 May 2021 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.marca.com/en/football/international-football/2019/04/26/5cc221ffe5fdea15628b460f.html |title=Papu Gomez and Ilicic fire Atalanta past Fiorentina and into Coppa Italia final |publisher=MARCA |date=25 April 2019 |access-date=3 May 2021 }}</ref>

Gómez scored his first [[2019–20 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] goal on 26 November 2019 with a brilliant piece of individual ability in a 2–0 home win against [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/atalanta-vs-din-zagreb/420404|title=Champions League (Sky Sports)|website=SkySports|language=en|access-date=12 December 2019}}</ref> During the [[2019–20 Atalanta B.C. season|2019–20]] season, Gómez set the [[Serie A]] record for most [[Assist_(association_football)|assists]] in a single season with 16 assists.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alejandro "Papu" Gomez mazy assist for Atalanta, tops Serie A in assists|url=https://mundoalbiceleste.com/2020/07/11/alejandro-papu-gomez-mazy-assist-for-atalanta-tops-serie-a-in-assists/|date=11 July 2020|access-date=3 August 2020|website=Mundo Albiceleste}}</ref>

During half time of Atalanta's [[2020–21 UEFA Champions League group stage#Group D|Champions League group stage]] match against [[FC Midtjylland]] on 1 December 2020, there was a heated exchange between Gómez and manager [[Gian Piero Gasperini]] over his positioning on the pitch. Gómez did not re-enter the pitch at the start of the second half. After starting in Atalanta's final group stage match against [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], the relationship between Gómez and Gasperini completely broke down.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Gomez v Gasperini: What happened? {{!}} Football Italia|url=https://www.football-italia.net/163474/gomez-v-gasperini-what-happened|access-date=18 January 2021|website=www.football-italia.net|date=14 December 2020}}</ref> Despite amending his relationship with the president, Gómez stated that his relationship with Gasperini could not be fixed;<ref>{{Cite web|title=Report: Gomez clears the air with Percassi {{!}} Football Italia|url=https://www.football-italia.net/164337/report-gomez-clears-air-percassi|access-date=18 January 2021|website=www.football-italia.net}}</ref> he made his last appearance for the club in a Serie A match against [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] on 16 December.<ref name=norush/> Gómez requested a transfer in the January transfer window, to which Atalanta agreed, stating however that they would not sell him to a Serie A rival.<ref name=norush>{{Cite web|title=Atalanta in no rush to sell Papu Gomez {{!}} Football Italia|url=https://www.football-italia.net/164326/atalanta-no-rush-sell-papu-gomez|access-date=18 January 2021|website=www.football-italia.net}}</ref>

[[File:Papu Gómez 2022.jpg|thumb|269x269px|Gómez playing for Argentina in 2022]]
In 2007 Gómez was picked to represent the [[Argentina national under-20 football team|Argentina Under-20]] team at the [[2007 South American Youth Championship]] in Paraguay. Later that year he was part of the Argentina squad that won the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]] in Canada.
