'''Christian Dannemann Eriksen''' (born 14 February 1992) is a Danish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the [[Denmark national football team|Denmark national team]]. He is renowned for his vision, technique, passing, and [[Free kick (association football)|free kick]] ability.

Eriksen began his senior club career at age 18 in 2010, playing for [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], where he won three [[Eredivisie]] titles and the [[KNVB Cup]]. In 2013, Eriksen signed for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in a [[Transfer (association football)|transfer]] worth £11 million (€12.45 million), where he was twice named the club's Player of the Year, was voted into the [[PFA Team of the Year (2010s)#Premier League 9|2017–18 PFA Team of the Year]], and later also reached the [[2019 UEFA Champions League Final]]. In 2020, Eriksen joined [[Inter Milan]] in a transfer worth €19.7 million (£16.9 million), and won a [[Serie A]] title.

During a [[UEFA Euro 2020]] match on 12 June 2021, [[UEFA Euro 2020#Collapse of Christian Eriksen|Eriksen collapsed]] on the pitch after suffering a [[cardiac arrest]]; he was given [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] and was later fitted with an [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]]. He returned to football eight months later with a move to Premier League club [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]], before transferring to Manchester United the following season.

Eriksen made his senior international debut for Denmark in 2010 at age 18, and has since earned over 120 caps, including appearing in five major tournaments; he was also the youngest player at the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]]. Eriksen is his country's fifth highest [[Denmark national football team#Top goalscorers|all-time goalscorer]], and was named [[Danish Football Player of the Year]] a record five times.

==Club career==

===Middelfart and Odense===

Born in [[Middelfart]], Denmark, Eriksen followed in the footsteps of his father Thomas when he started playing football in the academy of local side, [[Middelfart Boldklub|Middelfart G&BK]].<ref name="makings">{{Cite news |last=Ames |first=Nick |date=15 June 2018 |title=The making of Christian Eriksen: from the start he was a 'wow' footballer |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/15/christian-eriksen-making-of-denmark-tottenham |access-date=25 June 2018}}</ref> Eriksen's father was also one of the coaches at the time and in 2004 they helped the youth side finish unbeaten in the local youth championship for the third time in a period of four years.<ref name=makings/> The following year, he joined [[Odense Boldklub]] who competed in the Danish youth championships and within a year had helped the club to an age-group title. It was at OB that Eriksen first began showing signs of his technical ability, with his dribbling and free-kick techniques lauded by then-coach, Tonny Hermansen.<ref name=makings/> His form at youth level attracted the attention of a number of major European clubs, including the likes of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]].<ref>{{Cite news |last=Hansen |first=Niels |date=4 April 2008 |title=FC Barcelona kigger på OB-talent |language=da |work=[[B.T.
