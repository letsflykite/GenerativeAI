==Early life==
Mukansanga initially was involved in basketball but took up a career in football after being told that she was too young to join the national under-17 basketball squad. She approached the [[Rwanda Football Federation]] about joining a refereeing course after finishing secondary school but this was declined on the basis of her being too young again. She would later be allowed to take up a course with them after learning the laws of football herself in her own time.<ref>{{Cite web |date=18 November 2022 |title=World Cup 2022: Salima Mukansanga to 'open doors' for female officials |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/africa/63519142 |access-date=20 November 2022 |publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|last=Karoney|first=Celestine }}</ref> At the start of her career, Mukansanga officiated men's local amateur football matches and women's national second division matches in Rwanda.<ref>{{Cite web |date=20 November 2022 |title=Salima Mukansanga: I never dreamed of officiating at the men's World Cup |url=https://www.cafonline.com/development/women-football/news/salima-mukansanga-i-never-dreamed-of-officiating-at-the-men-s-world-cup |access-date=20 November 2022 |publisher=[[Confederation of African Football]] }}</ref>
