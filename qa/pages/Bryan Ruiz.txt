==Personal life==
Ruiz has two brothers; one of them, [[Yendrick Ruiz|Yendrick]], is also a football player. Both Bryan and Yendrick were teammates in Alajuelense for a period of two weeks before Bryan signed for Gent. It was not until 14 August 2013, when both played together for the first time, in a friendly that Costa Rica played against [[Dominican Republic national football team|Dominican Republic]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goldberg|first1=David|title=Bryan Ruiz y Yendrick Ruiz al fin cumplen su sueño de niños: jugar juntos|url=http://www.nacion.com/deportes/futbol-internacional/fin-sueno-ninos-jugar-juntos_0_1359664081.html|access-date=27 June 2015|work=La Nación|date=13 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Dominican Republic vs. Costa Rica 0–4|url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2013/08/15/world/friendlies/dominican-republic/costa-rica/1557688/|website=Soccerway|access-date=27 June 2015}}</ref>
