'''Gerardo Daniel''' "'''Tata'''" '''Martino''' (born 20 November 1962) is an Argentine professional [[association football|football]] [[Manager (association football)|coach]] and former player who currently serves as the head coach for [[Inter Miami CF|Inter Miami]] of [[Major League Soccer]].

Martino played mostly for [[Newell's Old Boys]] in his native [[Rosario, Santa Fe|Rosario]]. He holds the record of appearances with the team playing a total of 505 matches in all official competitions. He was also selected in a fan's poll as Newell's best player throughout the club's history.<ref name="Univision">{{cite web |url=http://futbol.univision.com/fifacopamundial/paraguay/article/2010-05-27/gerardo-martino-el-mas-paraguayo|title=Gerardo Martino, el más paraguayo de los argentinos comandará al equipo 'guaraní'|date=27 May 2010|publisher=UnivisiónFútbol.com|language=es|access-date=3 June 2010}}</ref>

Martino was chosen to replace [[Tito Vilanova]] as head coach of [[FC Barcelona]] at the start of the [[2013–14 La Liga|2013–14 season]], but announced his resignation on 17 May 2014, though his side finished runner-up in both the [[2013–14 Copa del Rey|Copa del Rey]] and La Liga that season. In [[2015 Copa América|2015]], he led Argentina to the [[2015 Copa América Final|Copa América Final]], only to be defeated by hosts [[Chile national football team|Chile]] on penalties. His team also finished as runners-up in the [[Copa América Centenario]], again losing to the defending champion Chile on penalties.<ref name="argentinaresignation">{{cite news |title=Gerardo Martino quits Argentina and blames 'serious problems' at AFA |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jul/05/gerardo-martino-quits-argentina-coach-afa |access-date=6 September 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=5 July 2016}}</ref> On 5 July 2016, Martino resigned from the [[Argentina national football team|Argentina national team]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/gerardo-martino-resigns-as-argentina-manager-as-team-s-chaos-continues-070516|title=Gerardo Martino resigns as Argentina manager as team's chaos continues - FOX Sports|date=5 July 2016}}</ref>

He was named the head coach of [[Atlanta United FC]], a MLS expansion team that began play in 2017. Martino led the team to an [[MLS Cup 2018|MLS Cup victory]] in their second season and was named the [[MLS Coach of the Year]] before departing for the [[Mexico national football team|Mexico national team]]. He spent three years leading the side and left Mexico following the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]].

In 2023, Martino returned to MLS, being appointed as head coach of [[Inter Miami CF|Inter Miami]], where he joined former [[FC Barcelona]] players [[Lionel Messi]] and [[Sergio Busquets]].

==Coaching career==

===Paraguay national team===
Martino was assigned as head coach of the Paraguay national football team in February 2007, replacing [[Uruguay]]an [[Aníbal Ruiz|Anibal "Maño" Ruiz]]. His knowledge and success while coaching [[Paraguay]]an clubs were the parameters that positioned him as the best option for the job (other candidates were [[Nery Pumpido]] and [[Miguel Ángel Russo]]). Previously, Martino had won the Paraguayan league four times from 2002 till 2006.

In 2008, Martino was linked for vacant managerial position of [[Iran Pro League]] side [[Steel Azin]] but the deal was cancelled due to personal reasons.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/iran/news/1825/%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86/2013/10/11/4326113/%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B9%D8%A7%DB%8C-%D8%B9%D8%AC%DB%8C%D8%A8-%D9%85%D8%AF%DB%8C%D8%B1-%D8%A8%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%87-%DA%A9%DB%8C-%D8%B1%D9%88%D8%B4-%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A8%DB%8C-%D9%81%D8%B9%D9%84%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%A7-%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%88%D9%84-%DA%A9%D8%B1%D8%AF-%D8%A8%D9%87?ICID=OP|title=Latest Football News, Transfer Rumours & More|website=Goal.com}}</ref> On 5 July 2010, Martino announced that he would be stepping down as Paraguay coach on their return from the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] in which he led Paraguay to quarter-finals. Martino confirmed that with his four-year contract expiring, he would not be extending his spell in charge of the national side.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/world-cup/story/_/id/806168/ce/uk/?cc=5739&ver=global |title=Gerardo Martino quits Paraguay post |date=4 July 2010 |work=[[ESPNsoccernet]] |publisher=[[ESPN]] |access-date=5 July 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709183917/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/world-cup/story/_/id/806168/ce/uk/?cc=5739&ver=global |archive-date=9 July 2010}}</ref> However, on 10 July 2010, Martino agreed to stay on as Paraguay coach until after the [[2011 Copa America]], in which Paraguay were runners-up after losing to Uruguay in the final.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2010/8806138.stm|title=Martino to stay as Paraguay coach|date=9 July 2010|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|access-date=11 July 2010}}</ref>

===Newell's Old Boys===
After [[Hernán Darío Gómez]]'s departure from the [[Colombia national football team|Colombia national team]], Martino received a proposition to coach the team but turned it down, opting instead to coach [[Newell's Old Boys]], one of his former clubs as a player<ref name=nobfifa>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614120207/https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/club=204/index.html|archive-date=14 June 2009|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/club=204/index.html|title=Newell's Old Boys|publisher=[[FIFA]]|date=26 July 2012|access-date=16 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imortaisdofutebol.com/2014/11/11/esquadrao-imortal-newells-old-boys-1987-1992/|title=Esquadrão Imortal – Newell's Old Boys 1987–1992|trans-title=Immortal Squad – Newell's Old Boys 1987–1992|publisher=Imortais do Futebol|language=pt|date=11 November 2014|access-date=16 June 2018}}</ref> and a club which at the time was dangerously close to relegation to the [[Primera B Nacional]], the second tier of Argentine football. However, a series of impressive results under Martino secured top-flight status for Newell's and Martino's reputation as a coach increased quite significantly.

Following his excellent first season at Newell's, Martino won the [[2012–13 Argentine Primera División season|2013 Torneo Final]], the second and final stage of the [[Argentine Primera División]] season and reached the semi-finals of the [[2013 Copa Libertadores]]. As a result, Martino won further plaudits as a coach, having transformed Newell's from a team facing relegation on his arrival to a title-winning side, in addition to the arguably more impressive feat of reaching the [[2013 Copa Libertadores]] semi-final, the pinnacle club competition organized by [[CONMEBOL]]. It was this startling turnaround that further increased Martino's stock as a coach, and his achievements at Newell's soon caught the attention of various clubs in Europe, including [[FC Barcelona]].

===Barcelona===

On 7 July 2013, Martino was confirmed as head coach of Spanish club Barcelona to replace [[Tito Vilanova]] who resigned three days earlier due to health issues.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://twitter.com/marca/status/359352370775339010|title=Tata Martino ya es entrenador del FC Barcelona|date=22 July 2013|publisher=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|access-date=22 July 2013}}</ref> He signed a two-year deal at Barcelona.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jul/22/barcelona-gerardo-martino|title= Barcelona appoint Gerardo Martino as successor to Tito Vilanova|date=22 July 2013|work=The Guardian|access-date=23 July 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/detail/article/gerardo-martino-new-coach-of-fc-barcelona|title= Gerardo Martino, new coach of FC Barcelona|date=22 July 2013|work=FC Barcelona official website|access-date=23 July 2013 }}</ref>

Three days later, Barcelona went on to win 0–3 at [[Celta de Vigo]] and Martino became the first coach in Barcelona history to not lose a game in their first 16 matches. On 20 November, Martino's unbeaten start as Barcelona coach came to an end after his 21st game in charge, as Barcelona lost 2–1 away at [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League]]. After conceding the [[2013–14 La Liga]] title on the last day of the season to [[Atlético Madrid]], Martino announced he was to leave his role after just one year in charge during which he did not manage to win any major trophy except the Spanish Super Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/17/barcelona-coach-gerardo-martino-leaves|title= Barcelona coach Gerardo Martino leaves in wake of Atlético title triumph|date=17 May 2014|work=The Guardian|access-date=21 May 2014}}</ref>

==Managerial style==
Gerardo Martino prefers to play a very high pressing and an attacking style of football. At Barcelona, Martino continued the club's preferred style of play [[tiki-taka]] along with his own tactics. All of Martino's teams have the same distinguishable traits: they play attack-minded football, they are creative and the style is based on quick passing. In addition, Martino's teams also pressure high up the pitch, play out from the back and depend on their youth systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/en/news/648484/gerardo-tata-martino-2013-14|title=Gerardo 'Tata' Martino (2013-14)|publisher=FC Barcelona}}</ref>
