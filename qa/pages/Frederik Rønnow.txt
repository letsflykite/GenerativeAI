===Brøndby===
In July 2015, Rønnow signed a four-year contract with [[Brøndby IF]].<ref>{{cite web |title=AC Horsens sælger Frederik Rønnow til Brøndby IF |url=http://www.achorsens.dk/ac-horsens-saelger-frederik-roennow-til-broendby-if |website=AC Horsens |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407053957/http://www.achorsens.dk/ac-horsens-saelger-frederik-roennow-til-broendby-if |archive-date=7 April 2018 |language=da |date=2 July 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> He made two appearances in the [[UEFA Europa League]] in which Brøndby were knocked out by [[PAOK FC|PAOK]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Hansen |first1=Nicolai Sabro |title=Video: Rønnow med et af få BIF-lyspunkter mod PAOK |url=https://www.tipsbladet.dk/nyhed/europa-league/video-roennow-med-et-af-faa-bif-lyspunkter-mod-paok |work=Tipsbladet.dk |date=20 August 2015 |language=da}}</ref> In the league he played 33 gamed as the team finished in fourth place.

In April 2018 it was announced that Rønnow would join [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] in July 2018, again mirroring the movements of Hrádecký.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/lukas-hradecky-eintracht-frankfurt-goalkeeper-departure-kovac-frederik-ronnow-478579.jsp|title = Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Lukas Hradecky confirms summer departure}}</ref> He made his debut in the [[2018 DFL-Supercup|German Super Cup]] on 12 August 2018.<ref name="FCB gewinnt Supercup - Lewandowski macht den Unterschied">{{cite web |title=FCB gewinnt Supercup - Lewandowski macht den Unterschied |url=http://www.kicker.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/startseite/d-supercup-fb-1/2018/1/4213948/spielanalyse_eintracht-frankfurt-32_bayern-muenchen-14.html |website=kicker.de |publisher=kicker |access-date=9 February 2019 |language=de}}</ref> He was brought in to be the starting goalkeeper and appeared in Eintracht's first three competitive games. Due to insecure performances, Eintracht loaned [[Kevin Trapp]] from [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] shortly before the end of the summer transfer window, and Rønnow lost his starting spot.<ref>{{cite news |title=Offiziell: Kevin Trapp zurück bei Eintracht Frankfurt |url=https://www.sport.de/news/ne3341938/offiziell-kevin-trapp-zurueck-bei-eintracht-frankfurt/ |work=sport.de |date=31 August 2018 |language=de}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Nøhr |first1=Mikkel |title=Rønnow: Ingen tvivl om at Trapp er nummer et |url=https://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/roennow-ingen-tvivl-om-at-trapp-er-nummer-et/ |work=bold.dk |date=27 December 2018 |language=da}}</ref> During his first season he made a total of two appearances in the league and in Europa League, in which Frankfurt reached the semi-finals.<ref>{{cite web |title=Eintracht Frankfurt beat Benfica to seal UEFA Europa League semi-final berth |url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/eintracht-frankfurt-benfica-live-europa-league-line-ups-stats-luka-jovic-trapp-3736 |website=bundesliga.com - the official Bundesliga website |access-date=11 December 2021}}</ref> Trapp signed a permanent deal after the 2018–19 season, but suffered an injury and was sidelined for large parts of the first half of the 2019–20 season.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kevin Trapp fehlt Eintracht Frankfurt bis Jahresende |url=https://www.sport1.de/news/fussball/bundesliga/2019/10/kevin-trapp-verletzt-sich-und-faellt-is-jahresende-aus |work=SPORT1 |date=1 October 2019 |language=de}}</ref> Rønnow replaced him in goal and was able to convince with strong performances.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vollstes Vertrauen: Eintracht Frankfurt setzt auf Frederik Rönnow als Trapp-Ersatz |url=https://www.sportbuzzer.de/artikel/eintracht-frankfurt-frederik-ronnow-kevin-trapp-ersatz-hutter-guimaraes/ |work=Sportbuzzer.de |date=3 October 2019 |language=de}}</ref>

====Loan to Schalke 04====
On 30 September 2020, he joined [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke 04]] on a year-long loan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://schalke04.de/en/team/frederik-roennow-joins-fc-schalke-04-loan/|title=Frederik Rönnow joins FC Schalke 04 on loan|publisher=FC Schalke 04|date=30 September 2020|access-date=30 September 2020}}</ref> Rønnow first replaced [[Ralf Fährmann]] as the starting goalkeeper and made 7 Bundesliga appearances. Then, he fell out with an injury; Schalke's managers [[Manuel Baum]], [[Huub Stevens]], [[Christian Gross]] and [[Dimitrios Grammozis]] relied on the services of Fährmann again after his recovery, which meant that Rønnow only came to four more appearances by the end of the season after Fährmann was sidelined with an injury.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kurioser Grund: Warum Ralf Fährmann beim FC Schalke 04 die Nummer eins ist |url=https://www.ruhr24.de/sport/s04/fc-schalke-04-ralf-faehrmann-torwart-nummer-eins-tor-grund-christian-gross-s04-gelsenkirchen-90160393.html |work=Ruhr24 |date=12 January 2021 |language=de}}</ref> With Schalke, he suffered relegation to the [[2.
