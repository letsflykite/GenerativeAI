'''Alfredo Talavera Díaz''' ({{IPA-es|alˈfɾeðo talaˈβeɾa}}; born 18 September 1982) is a Mexican professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Liga MX]] club [[FC Juárez|Juárez]] and the [[Mexico national football team|Mexico national team]].

Starting his career with [[C.D. Guadalajara|Guadalajara]] in 2003, it was during his final years with the team that he would be loaned out to [[Tigres UANL]] and [[Deportivo Toluca F.C.|Toluca]], with the latter deciding to purchase him in 2010.

Talavera made his debut with the national team in March 2011. Originally Mexico's third-choice goalkeeper for the [[2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], he became the team's starting goalkeeper following issues with the first and second-choice goalkeepers, in which Mexico would ultimately win. He would go on to be called up for the [[2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup|2013]] and [[2017 FIFA Confederations Cup]], the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]], [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], the [[2015 Copa América]], the [[Copa América Centenario]], and [[2016 Summer Olympics]].

==Club career==
===Guadalajara===
With [[Oswaldo Sánchez]] out during the first part of the [[Primera División de México Clausura 2005|Clausura 2005]] with a shoulder injury, Talavera entered the [[C.D. Guadalajara|Guadalajara]] team as a starter against teams from the [[Primera División de México]], and also coming through against South American teams in the [[Copa Libertadores]].

On 2 April 2006, Sanchez left temporarily to play with the [[Mexico national football team|Mexico national team]] for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] in Germany, leaving Talavera in goal.<ref>{{cite web|title=Soccer-Guadalajara's run ends as six players depart|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/print?id=2403172&type=story|date=9 April 2006|publisher=[[ESPN]]|access-date=31 August 2009}}</ref> Since then he has started six [[Primera División de México Clausura 2006|Clausura 2006]] games for Guadalajara. In the first game he started the club posted a 2–0 loss against Monarcas Morelia. This was followed by a loss to [[Atlas F.C.|Atlas]] in the ''[[Clásico Tapatío]]''. In the final game of the season, Guadalajara lost to [[Deportivo Toluca F.C.|Toluca]], 2–0, but after a terrible performance in the first leg of the quarter-finals against [[Chiapas F.C.|Jaguares]] when he made a big mistake in injury time that caused the winning goal for Jaguares, coach [[José Manuel de la Torre]] dropped him as the starter and was replaced by [[Luis Ernesto Michel]] and Guadalajara fought back and advanced to the semifinals. The next season, when Oswaldo Sánchez returned, Talavera saw himself as the third goalkeeper of Guadalajara, with Michel as the second keeper, after Oswaldo left Guadalajara, Michel was the starting keeper and Talavera the backup. After this, he didn't have any action with Guadalajara again, taking the decision to leave the club in order to have more minutes played.

===Tigres UANL===
Guadalajara loaned Talavera to [[Tigres UANL]] on a one-year loan in 2008,<ref>{{cite web|title=Es oficial llegada de Talavera a Tigres|url=https://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/liga-mx/es-oficial-llegada-de-talavera-a-tigres|work=Medio Tiempo|date=7 June 2008|language=es}}</ref> in which he rarely saw action with the team, as he was competing with [[Óscar Pérez Rojas|Óscar Pérez]] for the spot. Nevertheless, bad luck came for Talavera, as Talavera injured himself in training, making [[Enrique Palos]] the next in the line. After he had fully recovered, Alfredo was released from Tigres.

===Toluca===

Talavera was transferred to [[Deportivo Toluca F.C.|Toluca]] as a substitute for first team goalkeeper [[Hernan Cristante]], since he was injured for the [[2009–10 Mexican Primera División season#Torneo Apertura|Apertura 2009]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Toluca's Cristante Out Eight Weeks With Torn Ligament|url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/1663/mexico/2009/09/16/1504788/tolucas-cristante-out-eight-weeks-with-torn-ligament|work=Goal.com|date=16 September 2009}}</ref><ref name="Goal">{{cite web|title=Toluca's Alfredo Talavera Outperforms Former Teammate Oswaldo Sanchez|url=https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/114/mexico/2010/05/24/1940320/tolucas-alfredo-talavera-outperforms-former-teammate-oswaldo|work=Goal.com|date=24 May 2010}}</ref> On 26 July 2009, he made his league debut with Toluca playing against his former club Guadalajara in a 4–3 victory. He played as a starter in every game of the season as the team reached the [[2009 Primera División de México Apertura Liguilla|championship]] semi-finals, losing to eventual championship winners [[C.F. Monterrey|Monterrey]].

On 15 May 2010, Talavera made it to his first final as starter after defeating Pachuca 1–0 in the second leg of the [[2010 Primera División de México Bicentenario Liguilla|2010 Bicentenario championship]] semi-final (3–2 on aggregate).
