==Club career==

===Molde FK===
Horvath signed his first professional contract in 2013 with [[Tippeligaen]] club [[Molde FK|Molde]] in [[Norway]],<ref name="auto">{{cite web|url=http://prosoccertalk.nbcsports.com/2013/08/13/18-year-old-american-goalkeeper-makes-molde-fk-game-day-roster/ |title=18-year-old American goalkeeper makes Molde FK game day roster &#124; ProSoccerTalk |publisher=Prosoccertalk.nbcsports.com |date=August 13, 2013 |access-date=May 17, 2015}}</ref> having been recruited by Molde manager and former [[Manchester United]] player [[Ole Gunnar Solskjær]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americansoccernow.com/articles/ethan-horvath-s-rapid-rise-could-help-u-s-u-23s |title=Ethan Horvath's Rapid Rise Could Help U.S. U-23s |publisher=American Soccer Now |date=October 5, 2015 |access-date=May 21, 2016}}</ref> Horvath first appeared in a Molde matchday squad on August 10, 2013.<ref name="auto"/> He made his professional debut on May 16, 2015, replacing [[Ørjan Nyland]] in the 55<small>th</small> minute of the match.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fotball.no/fotballdata/Kampfakta/?matchId=6133974 |title=Kampfakta - fotball.no - Norges Fotballforbund |publisher=Fotball.no |access-date=May 17, 2015}}</ref> On July 1, 2015, Nyland was sold to [[Bundesliga]] club [[FC Ingolstadt 04|Ingolstadt 04]], leaving Horvath as Molde's starting goalkeeper at age 20. By the conclusion of the [[2015 Tippeligaen]], Horvath had helped Molde concede just 31 goals for the season, the second-best mark in the league only behind champions [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]].

Horvath backstopped Molde to a 5–1 aggregate victory over [[Pyunik]] in the second qualifying round of the [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League]], before a  4–4 aggregate loss on the [[away goals rule]] to [[Dinamo Zagreb]] in the third qualifying round. Later, in the playoff round of the [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League]], Horvath and Molde had a 3–3 aggregate win on away goals over [[Standard Liège]]. With Molde thus qualifying for Europa League Group A, Horvath joined [[Brad Friedel]], [[Kasey Keller]], [[Tim Howard]], and [[Brad Guzan]] as the only American goalkeepers ever to play in the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Europa League/UEFA Cup]] group stage.

On October 2, 2015, Horvath was named to the Europa League Team of the Week,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/newsid=2288423.html |title=UEFA Europa League team of the week |date=October 2, 2015 |publisher=UEFA.com |access-date=May 21, 2016}}</ref> a day after being named [[Man of the Match]] for a 1–1 draw against [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in which he notched 10 saves,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2015/10/01/american-exports-goalkeeper-ethan-horvath-stellar-molde-fks-europa-league-draw-ajax |title=American Exports: Goalkeeper Ethan Horvath stellar in Molde FK's Europa League draw with Ajax |publisher=MLSSoccer.com |access-date=May 21, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O-yWexFSTdw |title=Man of the Match |publisher=Molde FK Studio |access-date=June 22, 2016}}</ref> most notably from a point-blank header from [[Viktor Fischer]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/KHeneage/status/649680141128466433 |title=Ethan Horvath just pulled this stop off against Ajax |publisher=Kristan Heneage |date=October 1, 2015 |access-date=November 1, 2016}}</ref> Horvath led Molde to a first-place finish in [[2015–16 UEFA Europa League group stage#Group A|Europa League Group A]] with successful two-legged fixtures against Ajax, [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]], and [[Fenerbahçe S.K.

===Club Brugge===
On January 3, 2017, Horvath signed with Belgium's [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]] on a four-and-a-half-year contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clubbrugge.be/nl/nieuws/22906/ethan-horvath-naar-club-brugge |title=Ethan Horvath naar Club Brugge |publisher=Club Brugge KV |date=January 3, 2017 |access-date=January 3, 2017}}</ref> He debuted as Club Brugge's starting goalkeeper on May 5 in the Championship playoffs.

At the start of the 2017–18 season, Horvath resumed his position as the starting goalkeeper for Club Brugge, starting in the first twelve league matches including ten victories. He also started the Champions League qualifying matches against [[İstanbul Başakşehir]] and Europa League qualifying matches against [[AEK Athens]], both of which were defeats on aggregate. However, he was eventually benched and then kept out of the squad for much of the season, not receiving another run of starts until May 2018 in the Belgian First Division A Championship Playoffs. He started three matches in the league playoffs as Club Brugge finished as champions and thus qualified for the [[2018–19 UEFA Champions League]] group stage.

Horvath began on the bench for Club Brugge in the 2018–19 season behind Croatian international goalkeeper [[Karlo Letica]], but Horvath soon regained the starting job. Horvath posted a trio of consecutive clean sheets against [[AS Monaco]], [[Borussia Dortmund]], and [[Atlético Madrid]] in the UEFA Champions League group stage.

With [[Simon Mignolet]] joining Club Brugge ahead of the 2019–20 season, Horvath was once again relegated to the second-choice goalkeeper, being only used sparingly by the club.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sbisoccer.com/2020/10/horvath-could-start-for-club-brugge-in-mignolets-absence|title=Horvath could start for Club Brugge in Mignolet's absence|first=Larry|last=Henry Jr.|website=SBI Soccer|date=October 18, 2020|access-date=June 20, 2021}}</ref>

===Nottingham Forest===
On July 13, 2021, Horvath joined [[EFL Championship]] side [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on a free transfer following the expiration of his contract at Club Brugge.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/news/2021/july/First-summer-signing-checks-in/|title=First summer signing checks in|publisher=[[Nottingham Forest F.C.]]|date=July 13, 2021|access-date=July 13, 2021}}</ref> On May 29, 2022, Horvath came on as a substitute in Forest's [[2022 EFL Championship play-off Final|1–0 play-off final victory]] over [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] in the 90th minute, due to an injury for starting goalkeeper [[Brice Samba]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Booth |first1=Chuck |title=Nottingham Forest promoted to Premier League: Here's what the Tricky Trees must do to stay up |url=https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/nottingham-forest-promoted-to-premier-league-heres-what-the-tricky-trees-must-do-to-stay-up/ |access-date=May 30, 2022 |work=CBS Sports |date=May 29, 2022}}</ref>
