==Early life==
Garang Kuol was born on 15 September 2004 in an Egyptian refugee camp, after his family fled their war-torn home in [[South Sudan]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://au.soccerway.com/players/garang-kuol/810348/| website= Soccerway| title=G.Kuol | access-date=9 November 2022}}</ref><ref name="auto1">{{cite web |author=Zac Rayson |url=https://www.foxsports.com.au/football/socceroos/fifa-world-cup-2022-socceroos-garang-kuol-newcastle-united-who-is-kuol-brother-central-coast-mariners-goals-transfer/news-story/c21eb02659897dcb6123e096043cac63 |title=18yo superstar will become Australia's youngest-ever World Cup star: Who is Garang Kuol? |website=Fox Sports |date=9 November 2022 }}</ref> His parents, Mawien and Antonietta Kuol, had sought safety in Egypt before eventually settling in [[Shepparton]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], along with Garang and his five brothers.<ref name="goal">{{cite web| title = Garang Kuol: Newcastle's new Australian wonderkid tipped to become one of the world's best| website = Goal.com|url = https://www.goal.com/en-au/lists/garang-kuol-newcastle-australian-wonderkid-worlds-best/bltb8763ca0e90c1359#cs9e9b37ce2e1a35c9| date = 5 October 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Kemp |first1=Emma |title=‘It’s about being ruthless’: 18-year-old Socceroo Garang Kuol is ready to take on the world |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/18/its-about-being-ruthless-18-year-old-socceroo-garang-kuol-is-ready-to-take-on-the-world |website=The Guardian |date=18 November 2022}}</ref> Kuol's family arrived in Australia as refugees in 2010, and over time, the family grew to include ten members.<ref>{{cite web |title='A lot of our people lost their lives, it was an emotional time': Kuol's inspiration to flourish in football |url=https://keepup.com.au/news/a-lot-of-our-people-lost-their-lives-it-was-an-emotional-time-kuols-inspiration-to-flourish-in-football/ |website=KEEPUP |language=en-AU |date=8 November 2022}}</ref>

Growing up in regional Victoria, Garang's passion for football was influenced by his older brother, Kuol Kuol, who would take him and their other siblings to kick the ball every day. [[Alou Kuol]], Garang's elder brother, followed in the same path and trained to become a footballer. Garang learned from Alou and his other brother, Teng Kuol, playing for hours in their backyard, which greatly contributed to his development as a footballer.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Niva |first1=Daniel |title=From Shepparton to Qatar: Garang Kuol is Australia's Breakout Football Star |url=https://www.complex.com/sports/a/daniel-niva/garang-kuol-interviewani |website=Complex |publisher=Complex Australia |language=en-us |date=2 December 2022}}</ref> Garang and Alou familiarised themselves with their new home's football history by watching highlights of the Socceroos' previous [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] appearances, taking inspiration from Australian footballers like [[Tim Cahill]] and [[Mark Bresciano]].<ref name="goal"/><ref>{{cite web |title=Australia’s South Sudanese striker Garang Kuol all set for Premier League debut |url=https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/articles/australias-south-sudanese-striker-garang-kuol-all-set-for-premier-league |website=FIFA |date=2 December 2022}}</ref>
