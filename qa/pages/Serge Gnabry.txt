==Style of play==
Gnabry, who could not join Bayern's academy since it was a two-hour drive from his home in Stuttgart, went to Arsenal when he was only 15. He later battled for fitness and first-team minutes, so he was loaned out to West Bromwich, where manager Tony Pulis mentioned that he was not ready for top-flight football,<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/51615027 |title=Bayern Munich: Serge Gnabry on tears, tough times & finally realising his childhood dream |website=BBC Sport |date=25 February 2020}}</ref> and was not good enough to play at the Hawthorns.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://talksport.com/football/674857/arsene-wenger-serge-gnabry-arsenal-bayern-munich/ |title=ATTITUDE Arsene Wenger explains why Serge Gnabry 'lacked a bit' at Arsenal and accuses Bayern Munich of 'stealing' the player |website=talksport |date=26 February 2020}}</ref> Pulis later commented on him after his good performances with Bayern: "I'm amazed. We had him at West Brom, we took him on loan and we could never get him fit. He even got taken off in an Under-21 game and he went back to Arsenal and they sold him on ... To have him at West Brom and seeing him do what he's done is absolutely amazing."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://talksport.com/football/609755/serge-gnabry-arsenal-tottenham-tony-pulis-west-brom-loan/ |title=ALL WRONG Serge Gnabry: What Tony Pulis said about Arsenal and West Brom reject who tormented Chelsea, Tottenham and Lyon in Champions League |website=talksport |date=19 August 2020}}</ref>

His Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger said in 2020 that "he's creative, he can score goals, right-footed, left-footed, good power, good penetration, very, very clever with the timing of his runs... I knew he would have a great career. He can be a number nine, a number 10... he's a very intelligent player."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goal.com/en-sg/news/sad-wenger-admits-he-knew-gnabry-would-be-a-star-before/1mpgglzxqhe1d19cl04gaqqjao |title='Sad' Wenger admits he knew Gnabry would be a star before Arsenal exit |website=Goal |date=20 August 2020}}</ref> His coach at Werder Bremen, [[Alexander Nouri]], said: "He is lightning quick, a clinical finisher, but he puts a lot of work now into his defence... now he's making these deep runs back to his own box defending. He's capable of doing this work while on the other hand making deep runs in attack".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/bayern-munich-s-serge-gnabry-worked-hard-for-star-status-says-alexander-nouri-8615 |title=Serge Gnabry an 'extraordinary player', says former Werder Bremen coach Alexander Nouri |publisher=Bundesliga |year=2019}}</ref>
