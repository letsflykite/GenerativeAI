La{{hamza}}eeb was revealed to the public through a short film produced by Fractal Picture and co-created by Katara Studios, "A Visit from Mascot Verse".<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" /> He was named the first 'digitised' mascot,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Writer |first=Afroq |date=2022-10-11 |title=Explaining La'eeb: The first digitised mascot in World Cup history |url=https://afroqconnect.com/explaining-laeeb-the-first-digitised-mascot-in-world-cup-history/ |access-date=2023-05-13 |website=AfroQconnect |language=en-US}}</ref> from the 'mascot verse', "a place that is indescribable. We encourage everyone to imagine what it looks like" - which is open to interpretation.<ref name=":2" />

A water screen projection film created by Fractal Picture in collaboration with La'eeb was exhibited on the [[corniche]] of Qatar. Additionally, they produced a 3D LED digital billboard film that was displayed in Lusail.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fractal Picture, Katara Studios partner to bring our La'eeb for FIFA World Cup 2022 |url=https://www.financialexpress.com/business/brandwagon-fractal-picture-katara-studios-partner-to-bring-our-laeeb-for-fifa-world-cup-2022-2907319/ |access-date=2023-05-13 |website=Financialexpress |language=en}}</ref>

== Public reception ==

La'eeb has faced criticism for its ghostly appearance, which some have linked to the deaths of guest workers on World Cup construction sites. While some fans appreciate the mascot's reference to [[Arabian culture|regional culture]], others argue that it lacks a connection to football, as it cannot physically play the game due to its missing feet.<ref>{{Cite magazine |date=2022-12-03 |title=At Qatar's World Cup, Where Politics and Pleasure Collide |url=https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/12/12/at-qatars-world-cup-where-politics-and-pleasure-collide |access-date=2023-05-13 |magazine=The New Yorker |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=The Qatar World Cup mascot design is inspired by…a piece of traditional Arab attire |url=https://fastcompanyme.com/co-design/the-qatar-world-cup-mascot-design-is-inspired-bya-piece-of-traditional-arab-attire/ |access-date=2023-05-13 |website=Fast Company Middle East {{!}} The future of tech, business and innovation. |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Hashmi |first=Saquib |date=2022-04-23 |title=La'eeb Meaning: Official Mascot of FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 |url=https://www.thetealmango.com/sports/laeeb-meaning/ |access-date=2023-05-13 |website=The Teal Mango |language=en-US}}</ref>

Twitter users were particularly vocal in their opinions of La'eeb, with many likening the mascot to a ghost or [[jinn]], and some even referring to it as a "tissue paper" figure. Despite the criticism, there were also those who defended La'eeb's design and praised its cultural significance.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Hashmi |first=Saquib |date=2022-04-23 |title=La'eeb Meaning: Official Mascot of FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 |url=https://www.thetealmango.com/sports/laeeb-meaning/ |access-date=2023-05-13 |website=The Teal Mango |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last1=Ansari |first1=Dave |last2=Alizadeh |first2=Elham |date=2022-07-13 |title=Is La'eeb a Strategic Mascot?
