Yedlin earned his first call-up to the [[United States men's national soccer team|senior men's national team]] on January 3, 2014.<ref>{{cite web|last=Firchau|first=Nick|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/worldcup/2014/news/article/2014/01/03/world-cup-mls-mvp-mike-magee-headlines-27-man-january-camp-usmnt|title=World Cup: MLS MVP Mike Magee & Landon Donovan headline USMNT's January camp roster|work=MLSsoccer.com|publisher=Major League Soccer|date=January 3, 2014|access-date=January 4, 2014|archive-date=January 6, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106072742/http://www.mlssoccer.com/worldcup/2014/news/article/2014/01/03/world-cup-mls-mvp-mike-magee-headlines-27-man-january-camp-usmnt|url-status=dead}}</ref> He made his first appearance with the senior team on February 1, 2014, in a friendly against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.seattletimes.com/soundersfc/2014/02/02/usmnt-beats-south-korea-2-0-as-deandre-yedlin-earns-first-cap/ |title=USMNT beats South Korea, 2–0, as DeAndre Yedlin earns first cap |website=Seattle Times}}</ref>

After impressing in January and April, Yedlin was a surprise inclusion by US manager [[Jürgen Klinsmann|Jurgen Klinsmann]] on the U.S. final 23-man roster for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. He made his World Cup debut against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], coming on as a late second-half substitute. He helped set up Sounders teammate [[Clint Dempsey]]'s late goal which put the U.S. up 2–1. He also came on late in the next game, a 1–0 loss v. Germany; his deep cross to Dempsey was headed off target. In the round of 16 match against [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]], Yedlin came on as an early substitute for the injured [[Fabian Johnson]], providing most of the vertical threat for the Americans.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McCauley |first1=Kim |title=Fabian Johnson injured, DeAndre Yedlin replaces him for USA |url=https://www.sbnation.com/soccer/2014/7/1/5862294/fabian-johnson-injury-usa-belgium |website=sbnation.com |access-date=August 26, 2020 |date=July 1, 2014}}</ref> Yedlin's performances took many by surprise, being called a "breakout star" by the New York Times.<ref name=":0" />

Yedlin continued playing for the US after 2014, playing in both midfield for defense for Klinsmann. Yedlin was named to the squad for the [[2016 Copa América Centenario|2016 Copa America Centenario]], starting most games. Yedlin received a second [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] (and subsequent red) in a match against Paraguay.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2016/06/11/us-reaches-copa-america-quarters-with-1-0-win-over-paraguay/|title=U.S. reaches Copa America Centenario quarterfinals with 1-0 win over Paraguay|agency=Associated Press|date=June 12, 2016}}</ref> When healthy, Yedlin participated in the US's failed qualification for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] under both Klinsmann and [[Bruce Arena]]. Yedlin started at right back in the final qualification match, a [[Trinidad and Tobago v United States (2018 FIFA World Cup qualification)|1–2 loss to Trinidad and Tobago]] on October 10, 2017.

Yedlin continued to play regularly as a right back under 2018 caretaker manager [[Dave Sarachan]], taking on a leadership role in the new cycle as one of the few players carried over. “DeAndre, he is now one of the seasoned guys, you would say, with [[Cap (sport)|caps]],” Sarachan explained in September 2018. “I think, again, has shown a lot of maturation now in terms of his approach working with a lot of these young guys." Yedlin stated wanting to turn the page on the failed 2018 cycle: "obviously want to put the past behind us and we all know what happened... it’s kind of a clean slate, a fresh start. I am excited for that.”<ref>{{Cite web |last=Sciaretta |first=Brian |title=ASN: After strong start to season, Yedlin embracing new role with the USMNT |url=http://www.americansoccernow.com/articles/after-strong-start-to-season-yedlin-embracing-new-role-with-the-usmnt |access-date=2023-01-19 |website=www.americansoccernow.com}}</ref>

Yedlin continued under fulltime manager [[Gregg Berhalter]]. Yedlin [[Captain (sports)|captained]] the national team in a March 2019 friendly against [[Chile national football team|Chile]], finishing 1-1.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Pulisic's Early Strike Paces USA to 1-1 Draw vs. Reigning Copa America Champs Chile |url=https://www.ussoccer.com/mnt-travel-roster/2019/03/pulisics-early-strike-paces-usa-to-11-draw-vs-reigning-copa-america-champs-chile |access-date=2023-01-19 |website=www.ussoccer.com |language=en}}</ref> Yedlin missed the [[2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup]] due to a groin injury, but participated in the [[2019-20 CONCACAF Nations League A|group stage]] and [[2021 CONCACAF Nations League Finals|finals]] of the 2019-20 [[CONCACAF Nations League]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=USMNT's DeAndre Yedlin to miss 2019 Gold Cup due to groin injury; a look at potential options at right back |url=https://www.cbssports.com/soccer/news/usmnts-deandre-yedlin-to-miss-2019-gold-cup-due-to-groin-injury-a-look-at-potential-options-at-right-back/ |access-date=2023-01-19 |website=CBSSports.com |language=en}}</ref> 

On November 9, 2022, Yedlin was called up to the final 26-man squad for the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], being the only U.S. player to play in both the 2014 and 2022 FIFA World Cups.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Franca |first1=Michael |title=Yedlin on Call-Up: "Having made a second World Cup is an incredible honor" |url=https://www.intermiamicf.com/news/yedlin-on-call-up-having-made-a-second-world-cup-is-an-incredible-honor |website=intermiamicf.com |access-date=November 9, 2022 |date=November 9, 2022}}</ref> “He’s a glue guy,” Berhalter said after announcing the roster. “He’s there for the team, creates atmosphere for the team. Sometimes he’s a shoulder to cry on or talk to, other times he’s a motivator.” “There’s a queue of questions people have for DeAndre,” said Tyler Adams, the USMNT captain in Qatar.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Armour |first=Nancy |title=DeAndre Yedlin's role as USMNT's 'glue guy' as important at World Cup as defense {{!}} Opinion |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/columnist/nancy-armour/2022/11/19/deandre-yedlin-world-cup-experience-usmnt/10725795002/ |access-date=2023-01-19 |website=USA TODAY |language=en-US}}</ref> A report by Paul Tenorio and Sam Stejskal of [[The Athletic]] after the tournament revealed that Yedlin was one of the veterans on the team that pulled young star [[Giovanni Reyna]] aside after "an alarming lack of effort" after the Wales match, in which an injured Reyna did not appear. The report said that the situation became untenable and that it had to be addressed multiple times by players and coaches, after which Reyna eventually apologized to his teammates for his lack of effort. After the apology, several players on the team spoke up to hold Reyna accountable for his actions, and the 20-year-old turned a corner in regards to his effort in training, per the sources in the report.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Stejskal |first=Sam and Paul Tenorio |title=Gio Reyna apologized to U.S. teammates over his lack of effort, sources say |url=https://theathletic.com/3991695/2022/12/11/gio-reyna-usmnt-gregg-berhalter/ |access-date=2023-01-20 |website=The Athletic |language=en}}</ref>

Yedlin appeared in two matches in Qatar, both as a tactical substitute for right back [[Sergiño Dest]]. Yedlin appeared in the [[2022 FIFA World Cup Group B|Group B]] match against [[Wales national football team|Wales]], then again in the Round of 16 match against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=USMNT vs. Wales - November 21, 2022 {{!}} 2022 FIFA World Cup Qatar™ |url=https://www.ussoccer.com/competitions/70excpe1synn9kadnbppahdn7/matches/cqjyb3x9pe0qo4c42e95hxgd0 |access-date=2023-01-19 |website=www.ussoccer.com |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=U.S. Men's National Team Bows Out Of 2022 FIFA World Cup After 3-1 Defeat To No. 8-Ranked Netherlands In Round Of 16 |url=https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2022/12/fifa-world-cup-2022-usmnt-1-netherlands-3-match-report-stats-standings |access-date=2023-01-19 |website=www.ussoccer.com |language=en}}</ref>

During the [[2020–2022 United States racial unrest|2020-2022 racial unrest]] in the United States, caused by the [[Murder of George Floyd|police murder of George Floyd]], Yedlin was an outspoken ally of the [[Black Lives Matter]] movement, asking if there was truly "[[Pledge of Allegiance|liberty and justice]]" for all Americans and recalling the memories of his grandparents who had lived under the [[Jim Crow laws|Jim Crow]] system of racial oppression.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Yedlin |first=DeAndre |date=June 2, 2022 |title=https://twitter.com/yedlinny/status/1267797791205621760 |url=https://twitter.com/yedlinny/status/1267797791205621760 |access-date=2023-01-19 |website=Twitter |language=en}}</ref> Yedlin spoke about the country's long history of [[Police brutality in the United States|police brutality]] against African Americans: "as a young black man in America it's one of those things you just grow up with. You know you have a higher chance of being stopped by the police, or put in jail or eventually being killed."

Yedlin admitted he was questioning whether he'd continue to play for the National Team. “It’s something I’ve thought a lot about during this [[quarantine]],” Yedlin said. “My grandfather, my grandmother especially, I have a whole family of activists, they’ve always told me to stand up for what I believe in. There’s no amount of money that can make me shut up about something I think is wrong. It’s one of those waiting games to see if a change does happen. But if things go as they stand it’s hard for me as an African American male to represent a country that does things like this where all people aren’t equal.”<ref>{{Cite web |title=DeAndre Yedlin: Newcastle defender considering US career because 'people aren't equal' |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11678/12010573/deandre-yedlin-newcastle-defender-considering-us-career-because-people-arent-equal |access-date=2023-01-19 |website=Sky Sports |language=en}}</ref>
