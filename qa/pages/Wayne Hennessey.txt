'''Wayne Robert Hennessey''' (born 24 January 1987) is a Welsh professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{English football updater|NottingF}} club [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] and the [[Wales national football team|Wales national team]].

Hennessey's first professional games saw him set a new Football League record for consecutive clean sheets while on loan at [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]]. He played 166 times for [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] over eight seasons, including three years at Premier League level. After several injury setbacks, he moved to join [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in 2014. He played 132 total games in eight seasons at Palace, including their defeat in the [[2016 FA Cup Final]], and then played for [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] and [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].

A full international since 2007, Hennessey is [[Wales national football team|Wales]]' third most-capped player and its most capped goalkeeper, with over [[List of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps|100 caps]]. He was in the Wales squads for the [[UEFA European Championship]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016]] and [[UEFA Euro 2020|2020]], reaching the semi-finals of the former, and was also chosen for the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]].

==Early life and career==
Hennessey is a cousin of [[Terry Hennessey]], who earned 39 caps for Wales from 1962 to 1972.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/super-hennesseys-rise-continues-1001507|title=Super Hennessey's rise continues|date=20 April 2010|website=Manchester Evening News}}</ref> Born in [[Bangor, Gwynedd]] and raised in [[Beaumaris]], [[Anglesey]], Hennessey is a fluent [[Welsh language]] speaker.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wales players told to learn words of national anthem|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/mar/22/gary-speed-wales-anthem|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=22 March 2011}}</ref> and was educated at [[Ysgol David Hughes]] but switched to [[Connah's Quay High School]] as it was easier to travel to [[Manchester]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Where it all began for Wales' Euro 2016 goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/began-wales-euro-2016-goalkeeper-11425292|work=[[North Wales Daily Post]]|date=5 June 2016|first=Blake|last=Welton}}</ref> Hennessey began as a trainee at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] but was released in 2003, whereupon he joined the youth academy at [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. After progressing through the ranks, he signed his first professional contract in April 2005.

After remaining in Wolves' reserve and youth teams during the 2005–06 season, Hennessey was sent on trial with [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] in July 2006<ref>{{cite news |url=http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=406314&plid=50647&clid=113&cpid=11 |title=Stockport Robins admit McAllister interest |access-date=4 March 2007 |date=28 July 2006 |author=Alex Dunn |publisher=Sky Sports }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> with a view to a [[loan (sports)|loan]] move to gain [[first team (association football)|first team]] experience but was recalled to Wolves after an injury to their first-choice goalkeeper [[Matt Murray (English footballer)|Matt Murray]]. He did go back to Bristol City in August 2006, however, on a one-month loan deal,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://home.skysports.com/list.aspx?hlid=409245&plid=50647&clid=113&cpid=11 |title=Robins to sign young keeper |access-date=4 March 2007 |date=11 August 2006 |author=Mark Buckingham |publisher=Sky Sports }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> but he did not make an appearance and returned to his parent club early due to an arm injury.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/b/bristol_city/5271818.stm|title=Johnson eager to bring in keeper|date=21 August 2006|website=BBC Sport}}</ref>

==Club career==
===Stockport County===
To gain first-team football, Hennessey joined [[Football League Two|League Two]] side [[Stockport County F.C.|Stockport County]] in January 2007 on a one-month loan.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/stockport/6252807.stm |title=Hatters sign goalkeeper Hennessey |access-date=4 March 2007 |date=11 January 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> On his senior debut against [[Boston United F.C.|Boston United]], he kept a [[clean sheet]] and after keeping another five clean sheets in successive matches, his loan spell was extended by an extra month.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/stockport/6357051.stm |title=Stockport extend Hennessey loan |access-date=4 March 2007 |date=13 February 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

He went on to set a [[The Football League|Football League]] record of nine successive clean sheets and wins.<ref name="FL record">{{cite news |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/sport/story/0,,2026082,00.html |title=Leeds deeper in gloom as Nicholls says he wants away |access-date=4 March 2007 |date=4 March 2007 |author=Jason Tomas |newspaper=The Observer}}</ref> Stockport broke the 119-year-old record,<ref name="FL record"/> when they beat [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon Town]] 3–0 on 3 March 2007.<ref name="FL record"/> After this accomplishment, he was named the League Two Player of the Month for February 2007.<ref name="Hennessey's heroics secure award">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/stockport/6417015.stm |title=Hennessey's heroics secure award |access-date=4 March 2007 |date=4 March 2007 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> His feat also means he now holds County's record for the longest period without conceding a goal, beating [[Harry Hardy]]'s 85-year-old record. His record now stands at 857 minutes, from the start of his competitive club debut, against Boston United on 13 January 2007, until [[Oliver Allen (footballer)|Oliver Allen]] of [[Barnet F.C|Barnet]] scored on 10 March 2007. He therefore did not concede in his first nine-and-a-half matches of competitive club football.

===Wolverhampton Wanderers===
Hennessey was recalled by Wolves in April 2007 after another injury to first-choice [[Matt Murray (English footballer)|Matt Murray]],<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sportbox.tv/football/news/story.php?id=244508 |title=County lose Hennessey |access-date=16 April 2007 |date=10 April 2007 |publisher=Sportbox.tv |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929061750/http://www.sportbox.tv/football/news/story.php?id=244508 |archive-date=29 September 2007 }}</ref> and found himself on the substitutes bench for several games. When Murray broke his shoulder on the eve of Wolves' [[Football League Championship|Championship]] play-off semi-final first leg against local rivals [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]], Hennessey stepped in to make his Wolves debut.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/6651217.stm |title=Murray out with broken shoulder |publisher=BBC Sport |date=13 May 2007 |access-date=16 December 2008}}</ref>

With Murray sidelined for the whole of the [[2007–08 in English football|2007–08 season]] with yet another injury, Hennessey became firmly established at the club's number one, being an ever-present in the league and signing a new extended contract.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~1218608,00.html |title=New Deals For Young Duo |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C |date=18 January 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716192732/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~1218608,00.html |archive-date=16 July 2011 }}</ref> At the end of the season he was named in the [[PFA Team of the Year#Championship|2007–08 PFA Championship Team of the Year]] as well as being named Wolves' Player of the Season.<ref name="Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C">{{cite news |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~1303707,00.html |title=Hennessey Scoops Player of the Season Titles |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C. |date=2 May 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716192816/http://www.wolves.co.uk/page/News/0,,10307~1303707,00.html |archive-date=16 July 2011 }}</ref> ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' magazine ranked him  22nd in their Top 50 Football League Players list.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://fourfourtwo.com/blogs/footballleagueawards/archive/2008/03/02/fourfourtwo-50-best-football-league-players.aspx |title=FourFourTwo 50 Best Football League Players |work=[[FourFourTwo]] |date=2 March 2008 |access-date=16 December 2008}}</ref>

The 2008–09 season saw a strong start for Hennessey and Wolves with eight victories out of the first nine league games. This fine run ended against promotion rivals [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] with a 0–3 loss begun by an own goal from Hennessey.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/7639348.stm |title=Wolves 0–3 Reading |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 September 2008}}</ref> Soon after manager [[Mick McCarthy]] dropped him to the bench, citing mental fatigue as the reason.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/7654568.stm |title=Hennessey needs a rest – McCarthy |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 October 2009 }}</ref> Reserve keeper [[Carl Ikeme]] deputised and impressed enough to leave Hennessey on the sidelines until an injury ruled him out for the majority of the season. Hennessey then regained and kept his place in goal for the remainder of the season which culminated with promotion to the [[Premier League]] as champions after a five-year absence.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/8015237.stm |title=Wolves 1–0 Doncaster |publisher=BBC Sport |date=3 May 2009 }}</ref>

Hennessey began the club's 2009–10 Premier League campaign as first choice goalkeeper, making his 100th senior appearance for the club in a 2–2 draw at [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in October 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wayne Hennessey is one appearance away from Wolverhampton Wanderers landmark|url=http://www.birminghammail.net/birmingham-sport/wolverhampton-wanderers-fc/wolves-fc-news/2009/10/30/wayne-hennessey-is-one-appearance-away-from-wolverhampton-wanderers-landmark-97319-25051332/|newspaper=Birmingham Mail|date=30 October 2009}}</ref> However, after conceding four goals in two successive games, he was replaced by the more experienced [[Marcus Hahnemann]] and remained on the bench for the rest of the season as the club finished 15th.

In July 2010, Hennessey extended his contract with Wolves to run until the summer of 2015.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wolverhampton_wanderers/8788850.stm |title=Goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey signs new deal at Wolves |publisher=BBC Sport |date=5 July 2010}}</ref> The following season began with Hahnemann retaining the number one spot until his own loss of form saw Hennessey return to the starting line-up in November 2010. He then held on to the spot for the remainder of the campaign as the club narrowly avoided relegation on the final day.

During the 2011–12 season, Hennessey was part of the Wolves defence that went a club record of 30 consecutive league games without a clean sheet. They finally ended this with a goalless draw at [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in April 2012, but by then the team was rooted to the bottom of the table.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17643422 |title=Sunderland 0–0 Wolves|publisher=BBC Sport |date=14 April 2012 }}</ref> Despite the game halting this run, it brought bad news for Hennessey as he suffered a torn cruciate knee ligament during it that was due to keep him sidelined until Autumn 2012.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17754937 |title=Wolves goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey out for six months |publisher=BBC Sport |date=18 April 2012}}</ref> After completing several reserve games during his comeback he re-injured the knee during training in November 2012 which kept him out of action for the remainder of the 2012–13 season.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/wayne-hennessey-141112-486254.aspx |title=Crushing blow for keeper |publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C |date=14 November 2012 |access-date=14 November 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121117002150/http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/wayne-hennessey-141112-486254.aspx |archive-date=17 November 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/20325266 |title=Wolves keeper Wayne Hennessey ruled out for the season|publisher=BBC Sport|date=16 November 2012}}</ref>

He made his return to the Wolves goal during pre-season ahead of their 2013–14 campaign – with the club now in [[Football League One|League One]] having suffered two relegations since Hennessey's initial injury – but he was not selected to start the club's opening fixtures.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23340086|title=Wolves and Wales keeper Wayne Hennessey makes comeback|publisher=BBC Sport |date=17 July 2013}}</ref> On 12 August 2013 it was agreed for the goalkeeper to spend a month on loan at [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] as he recovers from his long-term injury problems.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/gloveman-to-glovers-120813-988291.aspx|title=Gloveman to Glovers?|publisher=Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C|date=12 August 2013|access-date=12 August 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814142511/http://www.wolves.co.uk/news/article/gloveman-to-glovers-120813-988291.aspx|archive-date=14 August 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> However, before this deal was officially concluded Hennessey suffered a hamstring problem while on international duty with the [[Wales national football team|Welsh national team]] and so the proposed loan was scrapped.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23715305|title=Wayne Hennessey: Wolves keeper's injury halts Yeovil loan|publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 August 2013}}</ref> Although, on 21 August 2013, after an injury to Yeovil's replacement goalkeeper [[Sam Johnstone]] Hennessey officially joined Yeovil Town on an initial one-month loan which was eventually extended until 17 November 2013.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23779668 |title=Wayne Hennessey: Wolves keeper cleared for Yeovil Town loan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=21 August 2013 |access-date=21 August 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24674195 |title=Wayne Hennessey: Yeovil Town keep Wolves goalkeeper on loan |publisher=BBC Sport |date=25 October 2013 |access-date=12 November 2013 }}</ref> He made his Yeovil debut in a 0–3 loss to [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] on 24 August 2013.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/23744657 |title=Yeovil 0–3 Derby |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 August 2013 |access-date=12 November 2013 }}</ref> In his penultimate home match Hennessey received the man of the match award after the Glovers achieved their first ever home win at [[Football League Championship|Championship]] by defeating [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/24590303 |title=Yeovil 3–1 Nottingham Forest |publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 October 2013 |access-date=12 November 2013}}</ref>

After his loan spell at Yeovil ended, Hennessey returned to Wolves but did not displace [[Carl Ikeme]] in goal. When Ikeme suffered an injury in January 2014, Hennessey declined to play in the following fixture against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], launching speculation that he wanted a move away from the club.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12040/9100583/league-one-wolves-goalkeeper-wayne-hennessey-declines-to-play-against-gillingham |title=League One: Wolves goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey declines to play against Gillingham |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |date=4 January 2014}}</ref> Although he subsequently apologised for his refusal to play,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25645844|title=Wolves goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey apologises for no-show|publisher=BBC Sport |date=7 January 2014}}</ref> he did not play again for Wolves and negotiations were later entered into with [[Premier League]] team [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]].

===Crystal Palace===
On 31 January 2014 Hennessey joined [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] on a three-and-a-half year deal for an undisclosed fee, with media speculation suggesting it to be an initial £1.6 million, with add-on clauses.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Hennessey Signs For Palace |url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2014/january/hennessey-signs-for-palace/ |work=Crystal Palace FC |date=31 January 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/25980091|title=Wolves' Wayne Hennessey joins Palace|publisher=BBC Sport |date=31 January 2014}}</ref> Hennessey made his debut for the Eagles in the team's final match of the [[2013–14 Premier League|Premier League season]], a 2–2 draw with [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on 11 May 2014.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theboltonnews.co.uk/news/11205470.Eagles_held_at_Fulham_despite_Gayle_brace/|title=Fulham 2–2 Crystal Palace|date=12 May 2015|work=The Bolton News}}</ref>

Hennessey's first appearance of the [[2014–15 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2014–15 season]] came with a 3–0 win at [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] in the [[2014–15 Football League Cup|Football League Cup]] second round.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/28847260|title=Walsall 0–3 Crystal Palace|work=BBC|date=26 August 2014}}</ref> On 25 October he made his first appearance of the season [[2014–15 Premier League|Premier League]] as a substitute for injured first-choice goalkeeper [[Julián Speroni]] in a 2–2 draw at [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/29671751|title=West Brom 2–2 Crystal Palace|date=25 October 2015|work=BBC}}</ref> He ended the season starting in Palace's final two league fixtures, wins against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], keeping his first Premier League clean sheet for the club in the latter match.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/32670817|title=Liverpool 1–3 Crystal Palace|date=16 May 2015|work=BBC}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/32770846 |title=Crystal Palace 1–0 Swansea|date=24 May 2015|work=BBC |access-date=22 July 2016}}</ref>

After starting in Palace's [[2015–16 Crystal Palace F.C. season|2015–16]] [[2015–16 Football League Cup|Football League Cup]] second and third round matches, Hennessey was selected to start the [[2015–16 Premier League|Premier League]] fixture against [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in place of [[Alex McCarthy]]. He kept a clean sheet as Palace won 1–0 at [[Vicarage Road]] and retained his place as the team's first-choice goalkeeper, making five consecutive league appearances.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.premierleague.com/en-gb/players/profile.career-history.html/wayne-hennessey|title=13 Wayne Hennessey|access-date=3 November 2015|work=Premier League}}</ref> He played in the [[2016 FA Cup Final]], lost 2–1 to [[Manchester United]] after extra time.<ref name=cupfinal/>

Hennessey played in all ten of Wales' qualifying matches for [[UEFA Euro 2016]], conceding just four times, as they reached their first major international tournament since the [[1958 FIFA World Cup]]. He was named in Wales' 23-man squad for the tournament as first choice goalkeeper but was forced to miss the opening game of the tournament, a 2–1 victory over [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]], after suffering a [[back spasm]] prior to the match, being replaced by [[Danny Ward (Welsh footballer)|Danny Ward]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36507888 |title=Euro 2016: Hennessey ruled out of Wales opener with back spasm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 June 2016 |access-date=12 June 2016}}</ref> Hennessey started the remaining matches as Wales progressed to the semi-finals of the tournament before losing to Portugal.<ref>{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Portugal 2–0 Wales |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/36658962 |publisher=BBC Sport (British Broadcasting Corporation) |date=6 July 2016 |access-date=7 July 2016 }}</ref>

On 3 September 2020, Hennessey reached his 35th clean sheet with Wales in a 1–0 [[2020–21 UEFA Nations League B|UEFA Nations League]] win over [[Finland national football team|Finland]], to break the previous record held by [[Neville Southall]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://clwbpeldroed.org/2020/09/05/wayne-hennessey-neville-southall-youngsters/ |title=Wayne Hennessey on eclipsing Southall record and the youngsters coming through |website=clwbpeldroed.org |date=5 September 2020 }}</ref> He was selected for the delayed [[UEFA Euro 2020]] in May 2021, but was now second-choice to Ward, who had taken his place while he was injured.<ref>{{cite news |title=Euro 2020: Uncapped Rubin Colwill in Wales' European Championship squad |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/57301006 |access-date=27 June 2021 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=30 May 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Wales goalkeeper Danny Ward: 'This is bigger than people realise' |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro-2020/news/026a-1298855a0aae-deeb847e9bab-1000--wales-goalkeeper-danny-ward-this-is-bigger-than-people-realise/ |access-date=27 June 2021 |publisher=UEFA |date=26 June 2021}}</ref> Hennessey earned his [[List of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps|100th Wales cap]] on 29 March 2022 in a 1–1 friendly match draw against the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] at the [[Cardiff City Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/60874724 |title=Wayne Hennessey celebrated 100 caps for Wales as their friendly with the Czech Republic ended in a draw in Cardiff.  |last=Pritchard |first=Dafydd |date=29 March 2022 |website=BBC Sport Wales |access-date=2 April 2022 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Wayne Hennessey: Gareth Bale says 100-cap goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey is Wales' rock |work=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/av/football/60902769 |access-date=2 April 2022 |language=en}}</ref>

On 5 June 2022, Hennessey made nine saves, the most in the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2022 European World Cup qualification]] without conceding, to secure a 1–0 win for Wales against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]] in the play-off final, and a place in the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], Wales' first such tournament since [[1958 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC/CAF–UEFA play-off)|1958]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12018/12628284/wales-player-ratings-vs-ukraine-wayne-hennessey-the-red-wall-magnificent-ben-davies |title=Wales player ratings vs Ukraine: Wayne Hennessey the red wall, magnificent Ben Davies |website=Sky Sports |date=5 June 2022 }}</ref> He was chosen for the final squad in [[Qatar]].<ref>{{cite news |title=World Cup 2022: The 26 Wales players carrying a nation's hopes |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63545011 |access-date=25 November 2022 |work=BBC Sport |date=9 November 2022}}</ref>

Before the 2022 World Cup began, Hennessey said that the place as Wales' starting goalkeeper was contested, as he had played more international games but was rarely used by Nottingham Forest, while Ward was playing regularly and performing well for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Pritchard |first1=Dafydd |title=Wayne Hennessey: Wales number one keeper spot 'up for grabs' |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/63676841 |access-date=25 November 2022 |work=BBC Sport |date=18 November 2022}}</ref> During the second group game against [[Iran national football team|Iran]], Hennessey was sent off with four minutes to play for a foul while the game was goalless; Then when [[Danny Ward (Welsh footballer)|Danny Ward]] came in to the ground; Wales made it 2-0 loss in favour of Iran with a late goal by [[Iran|Iranian]] [[Esteghlal F.C.|Esteghlal]] defender [[Rouzbeh Cheshmi]] at 90+8.In fact he became the third goalkeeper in FIFA World Cup history to be sent off, following [[Gianluca Pagliuca]] in 1994 and [[Itumeleng Khune]] in 2010. Wales went on to lose 2–0. Hennessey would become the only player to receive a straight red card in the 2022 World Cup; the other players who were dismissed in a tournament received two yellow cards in one match.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Chowdhury |first1=Sabyasachi |title=FIFA World Cup 2022: Wales goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey cops a red card after aggressive move to snatch ball from Mehdi Taremi |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/sports/football/story/fifa-world-cup-2022-wales-goalkeeper-wayne-hennessey-cops-a-red-card-after-aggressive-move-to-snatch-ball-from-mehdi-taremi-2301758-2022-11-25 |access-date=25 November 2022 |website=India Today |date=25 November 2022 }}</ref>

==Nazi salute controversy==
In January 2019, an investigation was launched by [[The Football Association|The FA]] after Hennessey was pictured making what appeared to be a [[Nazi salute]] in a group photo posted on [[Instagram]] by teammate [[Max Meyer (footballer)|Max Meyer]]. Hennessey denied making the salute, claiming that "any kind of resemblance to that kind of gesture is absolutely coincidental", despite appearing to have his left hand between his mouth and nose, mimicking a moustache, and right hand extended out in front of him. He provided photographs of him making similar gestures during matches to attract the attention of team-mates, although these photographs did not depict him mimicking a moustache with his other hand.<ref>{{cite news |title=Wayne Hennessey: Football Association looking into alleged Nazi salute |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/46796546 |access-date=11 January 2019 |work=BBC Sport |date=8 January 2019}}</ref> In April 2019, the FA said there would be no further action after the charge was "not proven".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47824250|title=Wayne Hennessey: FA charge for Crystal Palace goalkeeper's alleged Nazi salute 'not proven'|date=5 April 2019|website=BBC Sport}}</ref> Hennessey argued that he did not know what a Nazi salute was and the FA panel noted that "when cross-examined about this Mr Hennessey displayed a very considerable - one might even say lamentable - degree of ignorance about anything to do with Hitler, Fascism and the Nazi regime".<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/47946382 |title=Wayne Hennessey did not know what Nazi salute was - FA panel |website=BBC Sport |date=16 April 2019 |access-date=16 April 2019}}</ref>
