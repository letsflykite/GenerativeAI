'''Robert John Page''' (born 3 September 1974) is a Welsh [[Manager (association football)|football manager]] and former [[association football|player]], who is currently the manager of the [[Wales national football team|Wales national team]]. In an 18-year career in the [[Premier League]] and the [[English Football League]], he made 550 competitive appearances for six different clubs. He both captained a team and scored a goal in each of the top four divisions of English football.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisstaffordshire.co.uk/Port-Vale-Page-eager-coaching-steps/story-12914399-detail/story.html|title=Port Vale: Page eager to take first coaching steps|date=9 July 2011|work=The Sentinel|access-date=9 July 2011}}</ref> He also gained 41 caps for Wales in a ten-year international career, [[captain (association football)|captaining]] the side once, before he retired from international football in September 2006.

A [[defender (association football)|defender]], he began his career with [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in 1993, whom he would captain to two promotions, winning the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title in 1997–98 and the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] play-off final in [[1999 Football League First Division play-off Final|1999]]. He went on to be voted [[Watford F.C. Player of the Season|the club's Player of the Season]] in their [[1999–2000 FA Premier League]] campaign. He was sold to [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] for a £350,000 fee in September 2001 and helped the club to reach the First Division play-off final in [[2003 Football League First Division play-off Final|2003]], as well the semi-finals of the [[FA Cup]] and [[EFL Cup|League Cup]]. He signed with [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] in July 2004, before moving on to [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] in February 2005. He joined [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] in January 2008, before moving on to [[Chesterfield F.C.|Chesterfield]] in May 2008 and announcing his retirement in March 2011.

He worked as a coach at Port Vale for three years before he was appointed as manager, initially on a caretaker basis, in September 2014. In May 2016, he was appointed manager of [[Northampton Town F.C.|Northampton Town]] on a three-year contract, but was sacked in January 2017. He was appointed Wales under-21 manager two months later, before becoming assistant manager for the senior team, led by [[Ryan Giggs]], in August 2019. He became the team's caretaker manager in November 2020, when Giggs was suspended from duty, and oversaw two victories in the [[UEFA Nations League]] that secured Wales promotion into League A. He coached Wales at [[UEFA Euro 2020]], where they would reach the Round of 16. In June 2022, he led Wales to qualification for the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], the country's first World Cup appearance since [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]].

==Playing career==

===Watford===
Page started his professional career at [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] in 1993, having been with the club from the age of 11.<ref>{{cite web|title=Page Speech & Photos|url=http://www.watfordfc.com/news/article/130508-robert-page-speech-gallery-814589.aspx|website=watfordfc.com|access-date=11 August 2015}}</ref> He established himself as a key member of the first team under manager [[Kenny Jackett]], playing 42 games in the [[1996–97 Watford F.C. season|1996–97]] campaign. His first major feat with the club came in the [[1997–98 Watford F.C. season|1997–98]] season, when new manager [[Graham Taylor]] appointed Page as captain and led the "Hornets" to the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] title.<ref name="profile2">{{cite web |title=FAW / Rob Page in profile |url=https://www.faw.cymru/en/news/rob-page-profile/ |website=faw.cymru |access-date=13 November 2020 }}</ref> He made 49 appearances in league and cup competitions, and ensured the "Hornets" earned a vital point at second-place [[Bristol City F.C.|Bristol City]] in his final game of the season. Dropped at the start of the [[1998–99 Watford F.C. season|1998–99]] season in favour of [[Dean Yates]], he soon was returned to the starting eleven alongside centre-back partner [[Steve Palmer (footballer)|Steve Palmer]] and made 42 [[Football League First Division|First Division]] appearances to help Watford to a fifth-place finish. After defeating [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] in the play-off semi-finals, Page marshalled the Watford defence to a clean sheet in [[1999 Football League First Division play-off Final|the final]], as Watford defeated [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]] 2–0 to win a place in the [[Premier League]]. Page was named as Watford's Player of the Season for the [[1999–2000 Watford F.C. season|1999–2000]] campaign.<ref name="profile2"/>

As expected Watford were relegated at the end of [[1999–2000 Watford F.C. season|their maiden season]] in the Premier League.

He played in the club's play-off semi-final victory over [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], but was powerless to stop [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]] winning 3–0 in [[2003 Football League First Division play-off Final|the final]] at the [[Millennium Stadium]].
