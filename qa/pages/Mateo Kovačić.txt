In the [[2011–12 Croatian First Football League|2011–12]] season, Kovačić rapidly established himself as a first-team regular. He played mainly in the position of left midfielder in 4–2–3–1 system. Early in the season, he helped the team reach the [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League group stage#Group D|group stage]] of [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|the season's UEFA Champions League]] for the first time in 12 years. Being only 17 years old, he appeared in the starting lineup of Dinamo's first group match against [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]]. He finished his first European season with Dinamo by scoring a goal against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] in the last game of the group stage in Zagreb and thus became the second youngest ever scorer in the Champions League. In the domestic league, he was a regular starter, appearing in 25 league matches and scoring five goals in the process. During a league match against [[NK Lučko]], he became the youngest player to [[Captain (association football)|captain]] Dinamo, when taking the captaincy from [[Leandro Cufré]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Kvačić najmlađi kapetan u Dnamovoj povijesti |url=http://www.tportal.hr/sport/prvaliga/145385/Kovacic-najmladi-kapetan-Dinama-u-povijesti.html#.UQm78x32_Wo |date=27 August 2011 |work=Tportal.hr |access-date=31 January 2013 |archive-date=4 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004223151/http://www.tportal.hr/sport/prvaliga/145385/Kovacic-najmladi-kapetan-Dinama-u-povijesti.html#.UQm78x32_Wo |url-status=live }}</ref> It was another successful season for him in domestic competitions as he appeared in 32 domestic league and cup matches during that season, helping Dinamo to win their seventh consecutive league title. He also scored in the [[2012 Croatian Football Cup final|2012 Croatian Cup final]] against Osijek at [[Stadion Maksimir]]. In December 2011, he was named [[Croatian Footballer of the Year#Hope of the Year|Croatian Football Hope of the Year]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Kovačiću trofej Nada godine: Liga prvaka je bila uživancija |url=http://www.24sata.hr/nogomet/kovacicu-trofej-nada-godine-liga-prvaka-je-bila-uzivancija-248104 |newspaper=[[24sata (Croatia)|24sata]] |date=31 December 2011 |language=hr |access-date=31 December 2011 |archive-date=29 October 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029200325/http://www.24sata.hr/nogomet/kovacicu-trofej-nada-godine-liga-prvaka-je-bila-uzivancija-248104 |url-status=live }}</ref>

In the beginning of [[2012–13 Croatian First Football League|2012–13]] season, he suffered a metatarsal bone injury that caused him to miss several games on the club's qualifying road to another Champions League. He returned just in time to play in Dinamo's first [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League|2012–13 Champions League]] game against [[FC Porto|Porto]]. Kovačić played in all six Dinamo Zagreb's matches in the [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League group stage#Group A|2012–13 Champions League group stage]], against Porto, [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] and [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]].
