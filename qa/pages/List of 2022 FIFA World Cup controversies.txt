The decision of [[FIFA]] to host the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Qatar]] sparked a number of concerns and controversies regarding both Qatar's suitability as a host country and the fairness of the [[2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids|FIFA World Cup bidding process]].<ref name="Atlantic 2022">{{cite magazine |author-last=McTague |author-first=Tom |date=19 November 2022 |title=The Qatar World Cup Exposes Soccer's Shame |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/11/qatar-hosting-fifa-world-cup-soccer/672171/ |url-status=live |magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Emerson Collective]] |issn=2151-9463 |oclc=936540106 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221119231915/https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2022/11/qatar-hosting-fifa-world-cup-soccer/672171/ |archive-date=19 November 2022 |access-date=20 November 2022}}</ref><ref name="Reason 2022">{{cite magazine |last=Boehm |first=Eric |date=21 November 2022 |title=The Qatar World Cup Is a Celebration of Authoritarianism |url=https://reason.com/2022/11/21/the-qatar-world-cup-is-a-celebration-of-authoritarianism/ |url-status=live |magazine=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |publisher=[[Reason Foundation]] |oclc=818916200 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221121221030/https://reason.com/2022/11/21/the-qatar-world-cup-is-a-celebration-of-authoritarianism/ |archive-date=21 November 2022 |access-date=22 November 2022}}</ref><ref name="timesofindia">{{cite news |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=16 November 2022 |title=FIFA World Cup 2022: Why Qatar is a controversial location for the tournament |url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/football/fifa-world-cup-2022/fifa-world-cup-2022-why-is-qatar-a-controversial-location-for-the-tournament/articleshow/95533015.cms |work=[[Reuters]]/[[Times of India]] |access-date=22 November 2022}}</ref> Some media outlets, sporting experts, and human rights groups have criticised Qatar's record of [[human rights violation]]s;<ref name="Atlantic 2022" /><ref name="Reason 2022" /><ref name="foreignpolicy">{{cite magazine |date=25 November 2022 |title=Qatar Can't Hide Its Abuses by Calling Criticism Racist |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/11/25/qatar-cant-hide-its-abuses-by-calling-criticism-racist/ |url-status=live |magazine=[[Foreign Policy]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company]] |issn=0015-7228 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221127213633/https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/11/25/qatar-cant-hide-its-abuses-by-calling-criticism-racist/ |archive-date=27 November 2022 |access-date=28 November 2022 |author-last=Begum |author-first=Rothna}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=Tony Manfred |date=1 March 2015 |title=14 reasons the Qatar World Cup is going to be a disaster |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/news/14-reasons-qatar-world-cup-174400894.html |access-date=2 March 2015 |publisher=[[Yahoo!

In a December 2021 interview with Al Jazeera, [[FIFA]]'s secretary-general [[Fatma Samoura]] said that FIFA had developed a general framework to structure and guide the implementation of its [[human rights]] responsibilities and commitment, published in 2017, and that Qatar had implemented those recommendations.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fatma Samoura: The road to Qatar 2022 |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/program/talk-to-al-jazeera/2021/12/18/fatma-samoura-the-road-to-qatar-2022 |access-date=2023-04-21 |website=www.aljazeera.com |language=en}}</ref> After a thorough investigation, the International Labour Organization, claimed the figures "misleading" and said they had been wrongly linked to World Cup sites without proper context in November 2022 via reported drafted by France24. Labor Minister Ali bin Samikh Al Marri said [[Qatar]] already has started a Workers' Support and Insurance Fund to help workers which successfully reimbursed US$320 million this year alone to  victims through the Insurance Fund stated the ILO in November 2022. Furthermore, according to a statement by ITUC (International Trade Union Confederation) General Secretary Sharan Burrow, who had previously been a harsh critic of Qatar's labour laws, workers can now obtain justice in the country. She praised "the amazing change of the labour legislation in Qatar. In an article, which was published in September 2020, experts from the OHCHR (Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights) added, "We are very encouraged by the bold steps Qatar is taking to increase the protection of migrant workers' rights and ensure adequate living and working conditions for all."<ref>{{Cite web |title=UN human rights experts welcome Qatar's improvement of migrant rights |url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2020/09/un-human-rights-experts-welcome-qatars-improvement-migrant-rights |access-date=2023-04-21 |website=OHCHR |language=en}}</ref>

==LGBT issues==
{{Main|LGBT issues at the 2022 FIFA World Cup}}

Because of [[Islam]]ic [[Sharia|sharia law]], there are no [[LGBT rights in Qatar]], with homosexuality as well as campaigning for LGBT rights criminalised. As such, when Qatar was selected to host the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], the choice to do so in a restrictive nation saw much criticism, with several topics becoming the subject of controversy. The security of fans,<ref>{{Cite news |last=MacInnes |first=Paul |date=8 November 2022 |title=Qatar World Cup ambassador criticised for 'harmful' homosexuality comments |website=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/08/qatar-world-cup-ambassador-homosexuality |access-date=29 November 2022}}</ref> as well as the homophobic football chants of certain nations, were points of discussion.<ref>{{cite news |date=1 December 2022 |title=FIFA abre nueva investigación a México por grito homofóbico |language=es |trans-title=FIFA opens a new investigation to Mexico over homophobic chant |work=Vanguardia de Veracruz |url=https://vanguardiaveracruz.com/fifa-abre-nueva-investigacion-a-mexico-por-grito-homofobico/ |access-date=1 December 2022}}</ref>

The main controversy came from a last-minute FIFA decision to hand out player punishments to European captains who had months earlier announced their intention to continue wearing rainbow-coloured armbands (which began in 2020) in support of anti-discrimination; though not specifically in support of LGBT+ rights, nor targeting Qatar's lack, the rainbow symbol was deemed offensive to the hosts. Typically, kit violations incur a fine, which the teams had said they would pay; on the day of the first match involving one of the European teams, FIFA told the teams that they would receive a yellow card as a minimum.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Buckingham |first1=Philip |last2=Whitehead |first2=Jacob |date=2022-11-23 |title=Denmark ready to lead European withdrawal from FIFA over armband row |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/soccer/arid-41013320.html |access-date=2022-11-24 |website=Irish Examiner}}</ref>

Security officials at stadiums also confiscated items of rainbow clothing, flags featuring rainbows, whether [[Pride flag|Pride]]-related or not,<ref>{{Cite news |last=Delaney |first=Miguel |title=Fifa says rainbow colours are now allowed in Qatar after flags confiscated |website=Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/fifa-rainbow-lgbtq-qatar-2022-b2232145.html |access-date=1 December 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Church |first=Ben |date=28 November 2022 |title=Exclusive: World Cup soccer fans stopped by security officials for wearing rainbow-coloured items |website=CNN |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/26/football/german-soccer-fans-rainbow-colors-qatar-2022-world-cup-spt-intl/index.html |access-date=1 December 2022}}</ref> and reportedly intimidated fans.<ref>{{cite news |last=King |first=Jasper |date=30 November 2022 |title=England fan 'strip-searched' after wearing rainbow-coloured top and hat |work=Metro |url=https://metro.co.uk/2022/11/30/world-cup-england-fan-strip-searched-after-wearing-rainbow-clothes-17850629/}}</ref> American journalist [[Grant Wahl]] was briefly detained for wearing a t-shirt with a rainbow on it.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2022-11-22 |title=Rainbow-coloured clothing and items are causing a stir at the Qatar World Cup.

===Stadiums===
====Environmental impact====
Each stadium in Qatar requires 10,000 litres of water per day in winter months, when the tournament is taking place, to maintain the pitch. With little access to freshwater in the nation, the sourced water was saltwater, which has to be [[Desalination|desalinated]]. The process damages the marine environment. Desalination plants in the Middle East also heavily rely on the use of fossil fuels. As well as the pitches at the stadiums, the organising committee grew and maintained a large farm of match-suitable fresh grass outside Doha, in case of turf damage. The need for so much desalination, and the oil and gas used to power the plants, have been criticised.<ref>{{cite web|date=2022-10-07|title=10,000 litres a day for each pitch: water strain in the Gulf and the Qatar World Cup|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/oct/07/10000-litres-day-pitch-qatar-world-cup-huge-impact-gulf-waters|access-date=2022-12-10|website=The Guardian}}</ref>

One of the eight stadiums, [[Stadium 974]], was designed to be able to be disassembled so that it could be moved elsewhere, in an effort to counter the negative effect of requiring upkeep of unused stadiums. The large PR campaign promoting this was criticised by activists, as it overlooked the other stadiums being constructed in Qatar. Stadium 974 and the organising committee pledge that the tournament would be [[carbon neutral]] were also criticised as attempts to [[greenwash]] Qatar, the nation with the highest per-capita {{CO2}} emissions, especially as [[carbon neutrality]] was planned to be achieved by planting trees to offset emissions generated by the tournament, rather than use alternative energies. Stadium 974, located at a port, does not have air conditioning; due to the climate of Qatar, the other seven stadiums do, with the systems running on fossil fuels.<ref name=Sustainability>{{cite web|title=Qatar touts dismountable stadium for World Cup – DW – 11/25/2021|url=https://www.dw.com/en/qatar-touts-dismountable-stadium-for-sustainable-2022-world-cup/a-59921732|access-date=2022-12-10|website=Deutsche Welle}}</ref>

===Corruption===
There have been allegations of bribery or corruption in the Qatar's 2022 World Cup selection process involving members of FIFA's executive committee. There have been numerous allegations of bribery between the [[Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid|Qatar bid committee]] and FIFA members and executives, some of whom—including [[Theo Zwanziger]] and [[Sepp Blatter]]—were later recorded regretting awarding Qatar the tournament.<ref name="Rte.ie" /><ref>{{cite magazine |date=9 September 2013 |title=Sepp Blatter: Awarding Qatar World Cup may have been 'mistake' |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/20130909/2022-qatar-world-cup-mistake-sepp-blatter-winter/?sct=obnetwork |access-date=15 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921060538/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/news/20130909/2022-qatar-world-cup-mistake-sepp-blatter-winter/?sct=obnetwork |archive-date=21 September 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=16 May 2014 |title=Sepp Blatter: awarding 2022 World Cup to Qatar was a mistake &#124; Football |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/16/sepp-blatter-qatar-2022-world-cup-mistake |access-date=16 May 2014 |work=The Guardian}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Sepp Blatter admits summer World Cup in Qatar mistake - CBC Sports - Soccer |url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/sepp-blatter-admits-summer-world-cup-in-qatar-mistake-1.2645067 |access-date=17 May 2014 |publisher=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517222240/http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/sepp-blatter-admits-summer-world-cup-in-qatar-mistake-1.2645067 |archive-date=17 May 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

====2011====
In May 2011, allegations of corruption within the [[FIFA]] senior officials raised questions over the legitimacy of the World Cup being held in Qatar. According to then vice-president [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]], an email has been publicised about the possibility that Qatar 'bought' the 2022 World Cup through bribery via [[Mohammed bin Hammam]] who was president of the [[Asian Football Confederation]] at the time. Qatar's officials in the bid team for 2022 have denied any wrongdoing.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13592684.stm |work=BBC News| title=Valcke denies 2022 'bought' claim | date=30 May 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530112059/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/13592684.stm | archive-date=30 May 2011 | url-status=live }}</ref> A whistleblower, revealed to be Phaedra Almajid, alleged that several African officials were paid $1.5m by Qatar.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |title=Sorry Soccer |date=23 May 2011 |page=16 }}</ref> She later retracted her claims of bribery, stating she had fabricated them in order to exact revenge on the Qatari bid team for relieving her of her job with them.

====2014–15====
{{see also|Garcia Report|2015 FIFA corruption case}}
In March 2014, it was alleged that a firm linked to Qatar's successful campaign paid committee member [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]] and his family almost $2&nbsp;million. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that it understands that the U.S. [[FBI]] is investigating Warner and his alleged links to the Qatari bid.<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/10706977/World-Cup-2022-investigation-demands-to-strip-Qatar-of-2020-World-Cup.html |title= World Cup 2022 investigation: demands to strip Qatar of World Cup |work= The Telegraph |date= 18 March 2014 |access-date=20 March 2014 |location=London |first=Holly |last=Watt}}</ref>

On 1 June 2014, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' claimed to have obtained documents including e-mails, letters and bank transfers which allegedly proved that Bin Hammam had paid more than 5&nbsp;million US dollars to Football officials to support the Qatar bid. Bin Hamman and all those accused of accepting bribes denied the charges.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27652181|title='£3m payments to officials' corruption claim|work=BBC News| author=Bond, David |date=6 January 2014 |access-date= 1 June 2014}}</ref>

Later in June 2014, [[Qatar Airways]] CEO [[Akbar Al Baker]] gave an interview to German media in June 2014 stating that the allegations are being driven by envy and mistrust by parties who do not want the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] staged in Qatar, and that the country is not getting the respect it deserves over its efforts to hold the World Cup. He reiterated that the [[Qatari Emir]] strictly punishes and forbids instances of corruption and bribery with a [[zero-tolerance policy]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/handel-dienstleister/qatar-airways-chef-al-baker-bedingungen-der-gewerkschaften-toeten-lufthansa/10125510.html |title=Terms of trade union are killing Lufthansa |work=Handelsblatt |date=30 June 2014 |access-date=4 July 2014}}</ref>

====FIFA ethics investigation report====
In 2014, FIFA appointed Michael Garcia as its independent ethics investigator to look into bribery allegations against Russia and Qatar, the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup respectively. Garcia investigated all nine bids and eleven countries involved in the 2018 and 2022 bids and spoke to all persons connected to the bids and appealed for witnesses to come forward with evidence.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Qatar cleared but England criticised |language=en-GB |work=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/30031405 |access-date=2022-09-17}}</ref> At the end of investigation, Garcia submitted a 430-page report in September 2015. FIFA governing body then appointed a German judge Hans Joachim Eckert who reviewed and presented a 42-page summary of the report two months later. The report cleared Qatar and Russia of bribery allegations stating that Qatar "pulled [[Aspire Academy|Aspire]] into the orbit of the bid in significant ways" but did not "compromise the integrity" of the overall bid process.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |title=Fifa corruption report - what now? |language=en-GB |work=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/30042309 |access-date=2022-09-17}}</ref>

Michael Garcia reacted almost immediately stating that the report is “materially incomplete” and with “erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions".<ref name=":0" /> In 2017, a German journalist Peter Rossberg who claimed to have obtained the report wrote in a Facebook post that the report "does not provide the proof that the 2018 or 2022 World Cup was bought" and stated that he would publish the full report bit by bit. This forced FIFA to release the original report as authored by the investigator Michael Garcia. The full report did not provide any evidence of corruption against the host of 2022 World Cup but stated that bidders tested rules of conduct to the limit.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Associated Press |others=The Associated Press is an independent not-for-profit news cooperative headquartered in New York City |date=2017-06-28 |title=FIFA releases report detailing alleged corruption in World Cup bids of Russia and Qatar |url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/la-sp-fifa-garcia-report-20170627-story.html |access-date=2022-09-17 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref> The report ended talks of a re-vote.

====2020====
In January, [[Bonita Mersiades]], a whistle-blower from inside Australia's 2022 World Cup bid published a book which alleges that in the months before the vote in December 2010, FIFA executives were privately worried that a Qatar win would leave a financial shortfall for the governing body in 2022 which [[Al Jazeera]] (now beIN Sports) agreed a secret deal to pay $100&nbsp;million if Qatar won the vote. According to the book, the deal took place with the involvement and knowledge of [[Jérôme Valcke]], secretary general of FIFA at the time who was later banned for nine years from football for corruption. ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' asked [[beIN Sports]] about the allegations, in which a spokesman characterised the bonus as "production contributions" which were "standard market practice and are often imposed upon broadcasters by sports federations and sports rights holders".<ref name=TG>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/10/qatar-fifa-world-cup-2022-damian-collins|title=Fifa facing urgent calls to investigate Qatar World Cup bid claims|work=The Guardian|first=Sean|last=Ingle|date=10 March 2019|access-date=24 November 2022}}</ref>

According to leaked documents obtained by ''The Sunday Times'', Qatari state-run television channel Al Jazeera secretly offered $400&nbsp;million to FIFA, for broadcasting rights, just 21 days before FIFA announced that Qatar will hold the 2022 World Cup. The contract also documented a secret TV deal between FIFA and Qatar's state run media broadcast Al Jazeera that $100&nbsp;million will also be paid into a designated FIFA account only if Qatar wins the World Cup ballot in 2010. An additional $480&nbsp;million was also offered by the State of Qatar government, three years after the initial offer, which brings the amount to $880&nbsp;million offered by Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup. The documents are now part of the bribery inquiry by Swiss Police.<ref name=JP>{{cite news|url=https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Qatar-offered-FIFA-880-million-for-hosting-the-2022-World-Cup-582998|title=QATAR OFFERED FIFA $880 MILLION FOR HOSTING THE 2022 WORLD CUP - REPORT|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=10 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/revealed-qatars-secret-880m-world-cup-payments-to-fifa-p3r5rvw9x|title=Exclusive investigation: Qatar's secret $880m World Cup payments to Fifa|work=The Sunday Times|date=10 March 2019}}</ref>

FIFA refused to comment on the inquiry and responded to ''The Sunday Times'' in an email and wrote "allegations linked to the FIFA World Cup 2022 bid have already been extensively commented by FIFA, who in June 2017 published the Garcia report in full on Fifa.com. Furthermore, please note that Fifa lodged a criminal complaint with the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland, which is still pending.

[[Damian Collins]], a British [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] (MP) and chairman of a UK parliamentary committee, called for payments from Al Jazeera to be frozen and launched an investigation into the apparent contract since the contract "appears to be in clear breach of the rules".<ref name=TG/>

Former UEFA president [[Michel Platini]] was arrested by French police on 18 June 2019 in relation to the rewarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar. He was detained at the Anti-Corruption Office of the Judicial Police outside Paris.

===Scheduling===
The notion of staging the tournament in winter proved controversial; Blatter ruled out a January or February event because it may clash with the [[2022 Winter Olympics]],<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/president/news/newsid=2221313/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128081035/http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/president/news/newsid=2221313/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=28 November 2013 |title=Blatter: Qatar 2022 won't clash with Winter Olympics |publisher=FIFA |access-date=16 May 2014}}</ref> while others expressed concerns over a November or December event, because it might clash with the [[Christmas]] season (even though Qatar is predominantly Muslim, the players in the tournament are predominantly Christian).<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/10321916/Fifa-warned-2022-World-Cup-in-Qatar-must-not-clash-with-Winter-Games.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Ben | last=Rumsby | title=Fifa warned 2022 World Cup in Qatar must not clash with Winter Games | date=19 September 2013}}</ref> The [[Premier League]] voiced concern over moving the tournament to the northern hemisphere's winter as it could interfere with the local leagues.

This was controversial within FIFA itself, due to a possible conflict with the Christmas season, and Vice-president [[Jim Boyce]] responded in saying that "it absolutely has not been decided as far as the executive committee are concerned.<ref name="Al Jazeera">{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/sport/football/2014/01/qatar-2022-won-be-held-june-july-valcke-201418111355918402.html |title=FIFA split over Qatar World Cup dates – Football |publisher=Al Jazeera |access-date=17 February 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109202536/http://www.aljazeera.com/sport/football/2014/01/qatar-2022-won-be-held-june-july-valcke-201418111355918402.html |archive-date=9 January 2014 |url-status=live }}</ref>

It was agreed all the stakeholders should meet, all the stakeholders should have an input and then the decision would be made, and that decision as far as I understand will not be taken until the end of 2014 or the March executive meeting in 2015. As it stands it remains in the summer with no decision expected until end of 2014 or March 2015".<ref name="Al Jazeera"/>
Another option to combat heat problems was changing the date of the World Cup to the northern hemisphere's winter, when the climate in Qatar would be cooler. However, this proved just as problematic as doing so would disrupt the calendar of a number of domestic leagues, particularly in Europe.<ref name="Rte.ie"/>

[[Franz Beckenbauer]], a member of FIFA's executive committee, said Qatar could be allowed to host the 2022 World Cup in winter. He justified his proposal on the grounds that Qatar would be saving money, which otherwise they would have spent in cooling the stadiums. Beckenbauer said: "One should think about another solution. In January and February you have comfortable {{Convert|25|C}} there". "Qatar won the vote and deserves a fair chance as the first host from the Middle East".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net//sport/2010/2010/12/201012414282409180.html|title=Qatar World Cup possible in winter|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=4 December 2010 |access-date=4 December 2010| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20101209054815/http://english.aljazeera.net/sport/2010/2010/12/201012414282409180.html| archive-date= 9 December 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> At a ceremony in Qatar marking the occasion of having been awarded the World Cup, FIFA President Sepp Blatter later agreed that this suggestion was plausible,<ref name="aljazwinter">{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/sport/football/2010/12/20101217143610760148.html |title=FIFA 'backs' winter 2022 Qatar cup – FOOTBALL |publisher=Al Jazeera |access-date=28 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101220033310/http://english.aljazeera.net/sport/football/2010/12/20101217143610760148.html |archive-date=20 December 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> but FIFA later clarified that any change from the bid position of a June–July games would be for the host association to propose.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2011/01/20/fifa-quashes-talk-winter-world-cup/ | work=Fox News Channel | title=FIFA quashes talk of winter World Cup | date=20 January 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124073645/http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2011/01/20/fifa-quashes-talk-winter-world-cup/ | archive-date=24 January 2011 | url-status=live }}</ref> Beckenbauer would later receive a 90-day ban from any football-related activity from FIFA after refusing to cooperate in the investigation of bribery.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/13/franz-beckenbauer-banned-fifa-qatar-world-cup|title=Franz Beckenbauer banned by Fifa for not taking part in World Cup inquiry| work=The Guardian | date=13 June 2014|access-date=7 November 2014}}</ref>

The notion of holding the Cup during Europe's winter was further boosted by UEFA President [[Michel Platini]]'s indicating that he was ready to rearrange the European club competitions accordingly.

In addition to objections by European leagues, [[Frank Lowy]], chairman of [[Football Federation Australia]], said a change of the 2022 World Cup date from summer to winter would upset the schedule of the [[A-League]] and said they would seek compensation from FIFA should the decision go ahead.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/sep/17/world-cup-2022-australia-compensation-fifa|title=World Cup 2022: Australia wants Fifa compensation for failed bid|work=The Guardian |author=Lutz, Tom |date=17 September 2013}}</ref> Richard Scudamore, chief executive of the [[Premier League]], stated that they would consider legal action against FIFA because a move would interfere with the Premier League's popular Christmas and New Year fixture programme.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/premier-league-chief-richard-scudamore-threatens-to-sue-over-2022-winter-world-cup-10068066.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225155030/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/premier-league-chief-richard-scudamore-threatens-to-sue-over-2022-winter-world-cup-10068066.html |archive-date=2015-02-25 |url-access=limited |url-status=live|title=Premier League chief Richard Scudamore threatens to sue over November/December proposal|work=The Independent|author=Peck, Tom |date=24 February 2014}}</ref>

In September 2013, it was alleged that FIFA had held talks with broadcasters over the decision to change the date of the World Cup as it doing so could cause potential clashes with other scheduled television programming. The [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] who had paid $425&nbsp;million for the right to broadcast both the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] and 2022 World Cups in the US, later voiced anger over the possible season switch, as doing so would clash with that year's [[NFL]] season, which takes place in the winter and with whom Fox also has a lucrative broadcasting deal. The network said they bought the rights with the understanding the tournament would take place in the summer, and if the change did go ahead they would seek compensation.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/10338089/Fifa-holds-secret-talks-with-broadcasters-over-switching-2022-Qatar-World-Cup-to-winter.html|title=Fifa holds secret talks with broadcasters over switching 2022 Qatar World Cup to winter|work=The Telegraph|author=Rumsby, Ben|date=26 September 2013|access-date=1 June 2014}}</ref>

On 24 February 2015, it was announced that a winter World Cup would go ahead in favour of the traditional summertime event. The event was scheduled to be held between November and December. Commentators noted the clash with the Christmas season was likely to cause disruption, whilst there was concern for how short the tournament was intended to be. It was also confirmed that the [[2023 Africa Cup of Nations]] would be moved from January to June to prevent African players from having a relatively quick two-week turnaround, although the monsoonal rainy season in its host country [[Guinea]] starts about that time.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/31627049 |title=Postponement of Afcon 2023 agreed - Jerome Valcke |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=2 March 2015}}</ref>

===Climate===
{{see also|Effects of weather on sport}}
As the World Cup usually occurs during the northern hemisphere's summer, the weather in Qatar was a concern with temperatures reaching more than {{Convert|50|C}}. Two doctors from Qatar's Aspetar sports hospital in Doha who gave an interview in November 2010 to ''Qatar Today'' magazine said the climate would be an issue, stating that the region's climate would "affect performance levels from a health point of view" of professional athletes, specifically footballers, that "recovery times between games would be longer" than in a temperate climate and that, on the field of play, "more mistakes would be made". One of the doctors said that "total acclimation (to the Qatari climate) is impossible".<ref>{{Cite web|title=Qatar Today November 2010|url=https://issuu.com/oryxmags/docs/qt_november_2010|access-date=8 June 2021|website=Issuu|language=en}}</ref>

The inspection team for evaluating who would host the tournament said that Qatar was "high risk" due to the weather. FIFA President Sepp Blatter initially rejected the criticism, but in September 2013 said the FIFA executive committee would evaluate the feasibility of a winter event instead of a summer one.

===Cost===
By some estimates, the World Cup is set to cost Qatar approximately US$220&nbsp;billion (£184&nbsp;billion). This is about 60 times the $3.5&nbsp;billion that South Africa spent on the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dohanews.co/post/9991438489/qatars-world-cup-will-cost-220bn-what-does-that |title=Qatar's World Cup will cost $220bn – What does that mean? &#124; Doha News |publisher=Dohanews.co |access-date=28 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005003036/http://dohanews.co/post/9991438489/qatars-world-cup-will-cost-220bn-what-does-that |archive-date=5 October 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Nicola Ritter, a German legal and financial analyst, told an investors' summit held in [[Munich]] that £107&nbsp;billion would be spent on stadiums and facilities plus a further £31&nbsp;billion on transport infrastructure.

===Qatari football record===
{{main|Football in Qatar}}
At the time of being awarded the tournament in 2010, [[Qatar national football team|Qatar]] was ranked 113 in the world,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/rank=196/index.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225145637/http://www.fifa.com/fifa-world-ranking/ranking-table/men/rank=196/index.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=25 February 2015|title=The FIFA/Coca-Cola World Ranking - Ranking Table.

The most prestigious accolade the team had won was the [[Arabian Gulf Cup]] twice, both times hosting. Since being awarded the tournament, they have also won the Arabian Gulf Cup for a third time in 2014 and the AFC Asian Cup in [[2019 AFC Asian Cup|2019]]. Qatar became the smallest country by land area to host the World Cup (less than half the size of [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954]] hosts Switzerland, when the tournament consisted of 16 teams). These facts led some to question the strength of football culture in Qatar and if that made them unsuitable World Cup hosts.

The [[Qatar Football Association]] has also been known to [[naturalise]] players from foreign nations for its own team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebesteleven.com/2010/11/qatar-national-team-naturalized-players.html|title=The Best Eleven: Qatar National Team - Naturalized Players|work=thebesteleven.com|access-date=29 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/62922312/naturalization-is-undermining-the-credibility-of-international-soccer|title=Naturalization undermines international soccer.|author=Graham Ruthven|work=SportsonEarth.com|access-date=29 May 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129052435/http://www.sportsonearth.com/article/62922312/naturalization-is-undermining-the-credibility-of-international-soccer|archive-date=29 November 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Examples include [[Sebastián Soria]], [[Luiz Martin Carlos Júnior|Luiz Júnior]] and [[Emerson Sheik]].

===November 2022 Infantino communications===
[[File:Gianni Infantino 2018.jpg|thumb|upright|FIFA president Gianni Infantino]]

===="Focus on the football" letter====
On 5 November 2022, [[Gianni Infantino]] and [[Fatma Samoura]] sent out a letter to all participating nations telling them to cease and avoid any further or current discussion of Qatar's poor human rights records to "respect all opinions and beliefs, without handing out moral lessons to the rest of the world" and to "[[stick to sports|focus on the football]]" as to "not allow football to be dragged into every ideological or political battle that exists". Notably, members of the UEFA Working Group such as [[Australia men's national soccer team|Australia]], [[Belgium men's national soccer team|Belgium]], [[Denmark men's national football team|Denmark]], [[England men's national football team|England]], [[France men's national football team|France]], [[Germany men's national football team|Germany]], the [[Netherlands men's national football team|Netherlands]], [[Norway men's national football team|Norway]], [[Sweden men's national football team|Sweden]], [[Switzerland men's national football team|Switzerland]], and the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] were specifically targeted for their involvement in trying to improve the conditions for migrant workers, women, and LGBT people. All of the nations criticised the letter, stating "FIFA acknowledged in their letter that football does not operate in a vacuum, however they seem to be calling for that to be the case. History has shown us that the pursuit of such a strategy will be self-defeating and only further erodes football's social license to operate."<ref>{{Cite web |last=Whitehead |first=Jacob |title=FIFA letter receives fierce backlash from World Cup nations |url=https://theathletic.com/3765555/2022/11/05/world-cup-fifa-letter/ |access-date=2022-11-07 |website=The Athletic |language=en}}</ref>

===="Today I feel" address====
On 19 November 2022, Infantino gave an hour-long address to the media during a pre-tournament press conference, during which he defended FIFA's hosting of the tournament in Qatar, and commented upon pre-tournament developments such as the banning of alcohol.<ref name="guardian_20221119">{{Cite web |last=Ingle |first=Sean |date=2022-11-19 |title='I feel gay, disabled … like a woman too!': Infantino makes bizarre attack on critics |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/19/fifa-gianni-infantino-world-cup-qatar |access-date=2022-11-20 |website=The Observer |language=}}</ref> He opened by declaring that he "felt" Qatari, Arabic, African, gay, disabled, and like a migrant worker, because he understood how it felt to be discriminated.<ref name="guardian_20221119" /> He argued that criticism of the treatment of migrant workers by Western critics was hypocritical because "for what we Europeans have been doing for 3,000 years around the world, we should be apologising for the next 3,000 years before starting to give moral lessons to people".

Since the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 Iranian Revolution]], the presence of Iranian women in Iranian stadiums had been illegal until October 2019 after the [[death of Sahar Khodayari]], when select Iranian women were allowed to enter the stadium after 40 years for a World Cup qualifier.<ref>{{cite web |title='An extraordinary feeling': Iran women attend football match |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2019/10/11/an-extraordinary-feeling-iran-women-attend-football-match |website=aljazeera |date=11 October 2019}}</ref> However, in March 2022, Iranian women were again banned from entering the stadium for a World Cup qualifier, with authorities using [[pepper spray]] to disperse them.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2022/03/31/iran-women-blocked-entering-stadium|title=Iran: Women Blocked From Entering Stadium|date=31 March 2022|work=Human Rights Watch}}</ref>

Former Iranian national team goalkeeper [[Sosha Makani]] called on fans to either boycott the event or create slogans and chants that highlight the Iranian government's involvement of the deaths of protestors [[Nika Shakarami]], [[Hadis Najafi]], [[Asra Panahi]] and [[Sarina Esmailzadeh]] to prevent the government from using footage of them in the stands as [[Propaganda in Iran|propaganda]], while ex-wrestling champion [[Sardar Pashaei]] called for a full ban of the national team until the government steps down.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-11-04 |title=As FIFA Says 'Avoid Politics', Iranian Players Ask For Boycott |url=https://www.iranintl.com/en/202211048860 |access-date=2022-11-06 |website=Iran International |language=}}</ref>

The US Federation confirmed it had done so to show support for Iranian protesters before deleting the post.

==Treatment of fans==
===Jewish and Israeli fans===
It was reported that Qatar went back on its word to provide cooked [[Kashrut|''kosher'' food]] and public [[Prayer in Judaism|Jewish prayer services]] at the 2022 World Cup, banning both activities. Qatar alleged that they could not "secure" the safety of publicly praying Jewish tourists, whilst many foreign Jews complained that they subsequently had no food available to eat. It was estimated that 10,000 [[Israeli Jews|religious Jews from Israel]] and around the world arrived to watch the World Cup in Qatar.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Klein |first=Zvika |title=Qatar won't allow any cooked Kosher food and public Jewish prayer|url=https://www.jpost.com/international/article-722891 |access-date=2022-11-19 |website=The Jerusalem Post |language=en}}</ref>

===Paid fans===
In 2020, Qatar began a fan engagement program promising to pay air travel, entrance tickets to matches, housing and even spending money for groups of fans from all competing nations. However, fans who are handpicked by the Qatari government are required to sing and chant when asked to, and are required to report any social media posts which are critical of Qatar.

During the World Cup, [[Nejmeh SC]] ultras from Lebanon were employed by the Qatari government to act as Qatar national team fans during their games. The 1,500 "adopted" ultras wore maroon t-shirts with "Qatar" stamped on front, sang the [[As-Salam al-Amiri|Qatari national anthem]] and beat drums while singing chants.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Montague |first=James |date=28 November 2022 |title=The Fans Screamed for Qatar.

When asked about the ultras from Lebanon, the Supreme Committee denied that the fans were paid in exchange for "coordinated promotion for the World Cup" and issued a statement describing the report as "absolutely false.” The DW fact check team claimed that they were unable to find any evidence that the fans shown in the videos had been paid for participating in the marches.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Fact check: Did Qatar 'buy' World Cup fans? – DW – 11/18/2022 |url=https://www.dw.com/en/fact-check-did-qatar-buy-international-world-cup-fans/a-63812616 |access-date=2023-05-22 |website=dw.com |language=en}}</ref>

===Accommodation===
In the days leading up to the tournament, videos emerged of the tournament accommodation, which consisted of shipping containers, some with a curtain leading to the exterior instead of four solid walls, and portable air conditioners. This accommodation cost over $200 a night. A [[Greek salad]] which costs $10, consisting of a small amount of lettuce, one slice of cucumber, and no [[feta]], served in a foam container was criticized as expensive and unpalatable. These criticisms led to comparisons to the ill-fated [[Fyre Festival]].<ref>{{Cite web |last=Marcin |first=Tim |date=2022-11-18 |title=The Qatar World Cup is already going viral for all the wrong reasons |url=https://mashable.com/article/world-cup-qatar-viral-disaster |access-date=2022-11-19 |website=Mashable |language=en}}</ref> One official fan village, comprising hundreds of shipping containers, still resembled a building site less than two days before the first World Cup match.

==Media incidents==
===Security interference===
Prior to the tournament, there were several reported incidents of altercations between broadcasters and Qatari security officials. Rasmus Tantholdt of Denmark's [[TV 2 (Denmark)|TV 2]] was interrupted by a group of security guards during a live broadcast from the [[Katara Cultural Village]], who threatened him and attempted to break their camera. Tantholdt responded to the group, saying "You have invited the whole world here. Why can't we film? It is a public place." Organisers apologised for the incident, claiming that it was a mistake.<ref>{{Cite news |date=2022-11-16 |title=Qatar authorities apologise for threatening Danish film crew at World Cup |language=en |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/lifestyle/sports/qatar-authorities-apologise-threatening-danish-film-crew-world-cup-2022-11-16/ |access-date=2022-11-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-11-16 |title=Danish reporter Rasmus Tantholdt describes 'stressful' incident with Qatar security staff |url=https://www.skysports.com/watch/video/sports/football/12748810/danish-reporter-rasmus-tantholdt-details-stressful-incident-with-qatar-security-staff |access-date=2022-11-20 |website=Sky Sports |language=}}</ref>

[[RTÉ]] journalist [[Tony O'Donoghue]] accused Qatari police of stopping him during efforts to film in the country on 17 November.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Pattle |first=Alex |date=2022-11-18 |title=Irish journalist hassled by Qatar police while filming for World Cup |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/irish-journalist-qatar-police-filming-b2228139.html |access-date=2022-11-20 |website=The Independent |language=}}</ref>

While the tournament was underway, Argentine television presenter Joaquín 'El Pollo' Álvarez was intercepted by heavy-handed Qatari forces while he was in the middle of a live TV broadcast in a street of Barwa Village, a complex in Doha specifically designed for Qatar's hosting of the tournament. Álvarez was interviewing an old supported in a wheelchair, when he was stopped by Qatari forces, who asked him if he was an accredited media representative. When he was searching for his press pass in his bag, an official became irritated and ordered the cameraman to stop filming, claiming that the street was "private". 
Álvarez said that the official threatened to arrest him, saying "I was frightened and thought they were going to take me prisoner... It's impossible to work and enjoy a World Cup like this".<ref name="metro">{{cite news |last1=Courtney-Guy |first1=Sam |last2=Couzens |first2=Gerard |url=https://metro.co.uk/2022/11/25/qataris-stop-presenter-from-interviewing-fan-in-wheelchair-live-on-air-17826126/ |title=Qataris stop presenter from interviewing football fan in wheelchair live on air |date=25 November 2022 |work=Metro }}</ref> 

The film crew were also threatened with the destruction of their equipment. Nicolás Magali, who was co-hosting the live broadcast from the TV studio in Argentina's capital [[Buenos Aires]], told viewers: "This is an example of severe censorship and we have to say so. They covered up the camera, didn't let us film, ordered you away in a rude fashion, and on top of that, the person doing the talking didn't identify himself".<ref name="metro"/><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.news.com.au/sport/football/world-cup/qatar-officials-shut-down-tv-broadcast-as-presenter-interviews-disabled-fan-in-wheelchair/news-story/6eacd147160670c291d5e93da88dcc0b |title=Qatar officials shut down TV broadcast as presenter interviews disabled fan in wheelchair: Another live broadcast from the streets of Qatar has been brought to a halt by heavy handed Qatari officials |date=25 November 2022 |work=news.com.au }}</ref>

===BBC controversies ===
Hassan Al Thawadi, the head of the Qatar World Cup, called some of the BBC's coverage of the tournament "extremely racist" and charged [[Gary Lineker]] with not engaging with the organisers before criticising them directly. The BBC said it had received more than 1,000 complaints about its coverage of the World Cup opener between hosts Qatar and Ecuador, and some users described the BBC's coverage of the World Cup as "racist".<ref>{{cite web |last1= Mitib and Lawton |first1= Ali and Matt |title=Qatari World Cup chief accuses the BBC of 'very racist' coverage |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/qatari-world-cup-chief-accuses-the-bbc-of-very-racist-coverage-36kcwkxcl|website=The Times |date=29 November 2022}}</ref><ref name ="aj_bbc">{{cite web |last1=Motamedi |first1=Maziar |title=Iran coach: Klinsmann should resign over 'outrageous' BBC comment |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/11/27/iran-coach-tells-klinsmann-to-resign-for-outrageous-bbc-comment |website=aljazeera |date=27 November 2022}}</ref>
Al Thawadi said since February, he had tried several times to have a meeting between the officials organising the World Cup and the hosts and pundits of the BBC, especially Lineker, but there was never any desire to listen to the Qatari side of the story. He claimed that Lineker never wanted to engage. In response to Al Thawadi, Lineker tweeted that he and his representative had not received any requests to engage with anyone involved in Qatar 2022. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported on emails showing efforts to arrange a meeting between Al Thawadi and BBC hosts and pundits ahead of the World Cup draw in April.

==Match incidents==
===Serbian incidents===
During the [[2022 FIFA World Cup Group G#Serbia vs Switzerland|Group G Serbia vs Switzerland match]] on 2 December, midfielder [[Granit Xhaka]] twice rattled the entire Serbian team. First, in the 65th minute, Xhaka grabbed his [[crotch]] in the direction of Serbian players, causing the entire Serbian bench to angrily respond to him and Serbian reserve goalkeeper [[Predrag Rajković]] being [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)#Yellow card (caution)|booked]]. Second, at the end of the match, Xhaka got into a fight against [[Nikola Milenković]] for his chants against Serbians, with both players going into the referee's book.<ref>{{cite news |title=World Cup: How Granit Xhaka managed to annoy the whole of Serbia's bench |url=https://www.givemesport.com/88091049-world-cup-how-granit-xhaka-managed-to-annoy-the-whole-of-serbias-bench |access-date=3 December 2022 |work=givemesport.com |date=2022-12-03}}</ref>

Many Serbian fans displayed slogans and attire related to the [[Yugoslav Wars]], such as "[[Serbia to Tokyo]]", and made racist chants and gestures toward Albanians during the second half of the game.<ref name=":3"/><ref name="atlantic"/> Between the two incidents between Xhaka and the Serbian players, FIFA issued a public address in the 77th minute of the game asking for "discriminatory chants and gestures" to stop.<ref name=":3">{{cite news |last1=Ames |first1=Nick |title=Serbia fans 'showed fascist slogans and sang about killing Albanians' at game |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/dec/03/serbia-fans-showed-fascist-slogans-sang-kill-albanians-world-cup-switzerland-qatar-2022 |access-date=4 December 2022 |work=The Guardian |date=4 December 2022}}</ref> Also, according to a [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovo Albanian]] fan, his [[Albanian flag]] around his neck was confiscated at the entrance before the game.<ref name=":3" /> Another fan was escorted out of the game by members of security after doing the Albanian [[Crossed hands|double-headed eagle]] celebration.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-12-03 |title=Fan escorted out of Serbia vs Switzerland for making controversial sign |url=https://www.givemesport.com/88091092-world-cup-fan-escorted-out-of-serbia-vs-switzerland-after-controversial-gesture |access-date=2022-12-12 |website=GiveMeSport |language=en-GB}}</ref>

Furthermore, Xhaka, an ethnic [[Albanians in Switzerland|Albanian]], enraged Serbian fans by wearing a jersey with the surname of [[Jashari]] written on it while celebrating after having won the match. Despite his claims that he wore the jersey to show support to his young Switzerland teammate [[Ardon Jashari]], Serbian fans and media interpreted the move as glorification of [[Adem Jashari]], a Kosovo Albanian soldier who founded the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]] during the [[Kosovo War]], and who is seen as a national hero amongst [[Albanians]] but as a terrorist amongst [[Serbs]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.index.hr/mobile/sport/clanak/zasto-su-srbi-poludjeli-na-xhakino-slavlje-s-dresom-na-kojem-pise-jashari/2417498.aspx |title=Zašto su Srbi poludjeli na Xhakino slavlje s dresom na kojem piše Jashari? |trans-title=Why did Serbs go mad about Xhaka's celebration with a jersey saying Jashari? |date=2022-12-03 |access-date=2022-12-04 |website=[[Index.hr]] |language=hr |first=Zvonko |last=Alač}}</ref>

=== Netherlands vs Argentina quarter-final ===
{{main|Battle of Lusail}}
Spanish referee [[Antonio Mateu Lahoz]] officiated the second quarter-final, held on 9 December, a game between the Netherlands and Argentina. Mateu Lahoz's decision-making throughout this game was called into question by many of those involved, as well as by neutral observers. [[BBC]] presenter [[Gary Lineker]] at one point during the game commented: "13 yellow cards. This referee has always loved to be the centre of attention. Makes [[Mike Dean (referee)|Mike Dean]] seem shy."<ref name="Lahoz_Dean">{{cite news |last1=Wells |first1=Darren |title=Gary Lineker compares Netherlands vs Argentina referee to Mike Dean |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/argentina-netherlands-referee-world-cup-28699260 |access-date=10 December 2022 |work=The Mirror |date=9 December 2022}}</ref> Ultimately, Mateu Lahoz produced a FIFA World Cup record of 18 yellow cards, including to people who were sitting on the bench and thus not involved in the game.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Emma |title=World Cup 2022: Netherlands and Argentina descend into chaos as new yellow card record set |work=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63920253 |access-date=10 December 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Netherlands vs Argentina |url=https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/match-centre/match/17/255711/285074/400128139?country=IT&wtw-filter=ALL |website=FIFA Match centre |access-date=10 December 2022}}</ref> After the end of the game, Mateu Lahoz issued a red card to Netherlands player [[Denzel Dumfries]], however no TV commentator picked up on this, leaving viewers who checked the match reports afterwards puzzled.<ref name="Lahoz_Dean" /><ref>{{cite news |title=How many yellow, red cards have been shown by referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz in Netherlands vs Argentina FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 quarterfinal? |url=https://sportstar.thehindu.com/football/fifa-world-cup/news/argentina-vs-netherlands-yellow-cards-bookings-suspension-quarterfinal-antonio-mateu-lahoz-controversy-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022/article66245213.ece |access-date=10 December 2022 |work=Sportstar |date=10 December 2022}}</ref> During the extra time period (which resulted from Netherlands striker [[Wout Weghorst]] scoring an equalising goal with the last kick of normal time, which itself went on for ten minutes extra due to the number of stoppages), BBC commentator [[Martin Keown]] remarked: "I think the referee is losing the plot here."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Fish |first1=Hal |title='My God' - Aguero furious with referee Mateu Lahoz 'attention-seeking' display in heated Argentina clash with Netherlands |url=https://www.goal.com/en-us/news/aguero-argentina-messi-netherlands-lahoz-world-cup-referee/bltcf9d8de7a7881b9c |website=Goal |access-date=10 December 2022}}</ref>

Earlier, and with Argentina giving up a two-goal lead to leave the score at 2–2, Argentina's [[Leandro Paredes]] fouled his opponent [[Nathan Aké]]. Paredes responded to the referee's whistle by angrily kicking the ball at the Dutch bench on which staff and players were seated. Enraged Dutch staff and players poured onto the pitch, followed by Argentine staff and player, sparking an on-pitch brawl featuring players and substitutes. Netherlands captain [[Virgil van Dijk]] was seen charging forward and knocking Paredes to the ground.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Allen |first1=Patrick |title=WATCH: Van Dijk FLATTENS him!

After the game [[Lionel Messi]] asked FIFA to expel Mateu Lahoz.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Rathborn |first1=Jack |title=Lionel Messi urges Fifa to drop Netherlands vs Argentina referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/lionel-messi-argentina-netherlands-referee-lahoz-b2242571.html |access-date=10 December 2022 |work=The Independent |date=9 December 2022}}</ref> Messi also criticised the Netherlands manager: "[[Louis van Gaal]] says they play good football, but what he did was put tall people and spam long balls" and blamed Mateu Lahoz for causing the game to go on longer than it should have: "The referee sent us into extra time".<ref>{{cite web |last1=Arora |first1=Udhav |title=Lionel Messi disses Mateu Lahoz and Louis van Gaal after Argentina's win against Netherlands |url=https://barcauniversal.com/lionel-messi-disses-mateu-lahoz-and-louis-van-gaal-after-argentinas-win-against-netherlands/ |website=Barca News |date=9 December 2022 |access-date=10 December 2022}}</ref> The referee's decision not to show the yellow card to Messi for a deliberate handball also attracted comment, though Messi was eventually booked in the 10th minute of injury time at the end of the second half, at which point he would have been sent off with a red card if he had been booked for the earlier foul.<ref>{{cite news |title=Vicious Messi epitomises vengeful Argentina — and his nation loves him for it |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/vicious-messi-epitomises-vengeful-argentina-and-his-nation-loves-him-for-it-w3ds7jl5z |website=The Times |access-date=10 December 2022|last1=Carlin |first1=John }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Furious Argentina keeper Emi Martinez hits out at 'useless' referee |url=https://www.rte.ie/sport/world-cup-2022/2022/1209/1341061-furious-martinez-hits-out-at-useless-referee/ |access-date=10 December 2022 |work=RTÉ |date=9 December 2022 |quote="Though it was hotly debated as to which team benefitted from the bulk of the calls - with many noting that Lionel Messi was lucky to avoid a yellow card for a plainly deliberate handball - Martínez, speaking afterwards to BeIN Sports, insisted that his team had received a raw deal and branded referee 'useless'"}}</ref> Argentina's goalkeeper [[Emiliano Martínez]] described Mateu Lahoz as "crazy, the worst referee of the tournament, he is arrogant.

Before Argentine player [[Lautaro Martínez]] started walking to kick his penalty shot, several Dutch players started to surround him, in an attempt to psych him out, even though a player is supposed to go to kick the shot alone. He would later go on to score Argentina's decisive shot, that qualified them to the semifinals. Immediately following the penalty shootout victory, several Argentina players goaded the losing Netherlands players, e.g. [[Nicolás Otamendi]] raised his hands behind his ears, [[Leandro Paredes]] and [[Gonzalo Montiel]] gestured directly at them, while [[Alexis Mac Allister]], [[Germán Pezzella]] and [[Ángel Di María]] screamed at their beaten opponents, action harshly shunned by some foreign commentators and claimed as misunderstood by some others.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Leeks |first1=Jacob |title=Argentina players show complete lack of class with reaction to win over Netherlands |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/argentina-world-cup-netherlands-celebrations-28699371 |access-date=10 December 2022 |work=The Mirror |date=9 December 2022}}</ref> However, the next day, an overhead camera recorded the incident between Martínez and the chasing Dutch players.<ref>{{cite news |title= An overhead camera captured a gesture from the Dutch players that explains the subsequent misinterpreted reaction of the Argentines|url=https://www.pagina12.com.ar/506590-la-imagen-que-muestra-la-actitud-de-los-neerlandeses-en-los- |access-date=10 December 2022 |work=Página 12 |language=spanish |date=10 December 2022}}</ref>

===Penalties record for Argentina===
A lot of penalties were given throughout the tournament, but the most controversy case was the record of most penalties awarded in a single competition. Argentina was awarded with 5 penalties in the world cup, most of them generated controversy in the media. A lot of fans said that the world cup was rigged for argentina, especially for Lionel Messi, because most penalties weren't. Soccer players like [[Bruno Fernandes]], [[Pepe (footballer, born 1983)|Pepe]], [[Iker Casillas|Iker casillas]], [[Diego Lugano]] said that Argentina was favoured by the referees throughout the tournament. In the final, a lot of Commnetators, even argentinians said that Di maria's panalty wasn't while they were narrating the game live.<ref>https://www.ole.com.ar/mundial/mundial-qatar-2022/mundial-qatar-2022-pepe-facundo-tello-portugal-argentina-messi_0_4Q1Qqmm5ed.html</ref> <ref>https://elcomercio.pe/mundial/argentina/qatar-2022-iker-casillas-cree-que-el-penal-del-argentina-croacia-no-debio-cobrarse-foto-rmmd-ar-noticia/</ref><ref>https://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/copa-mundial/penal-a-favor-de-argentina-genera-polemica-redes-sociales</ref>
