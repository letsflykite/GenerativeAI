== Controversy ==
In May 2021, a video circulated online showing Lang joining an [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] chant of the Club Brugge supporters aimed at rival [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]], who is seen as historically linked to the Jewish community.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/brugge-star-investigated-joining-anti-133847134.html|title=Brugge's Lang investigated for joining anti-Semitic chant|website=Yahoo|date=22 May 2021|accessdate=17 July 2021}}</ref> He was investigated by the [[Royal Belgian Football Association]].

I’m done with the subject and won’t be revisiting it." Noa Lang, who played with AFC Ajax, before joining Club Brugge, was defended by the team's organisation claiming that "there was no anti-Semitic undertone".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.voetbalzone.nl/doc.asp?uid=388710|title=Club Brugge komt met statement: 'Noa Lang was jarenlang speler bij Ajax|website=Voetbalzone|date=21 May 2021}}</ref> The Club Brugge fans have been noticed by the press for racist chants.<ref>"Racism Amongst Club Brugge Fans: Supporters from CB and RSC Anderlecht Give Their Opinion on What Happened During Sundays Match – 21bis." 21bis – Mediaplatform Voor Studenten, 21bis.be/2021/12/racism-amoungst-club-brugge-fans-supporters-from-cb-and-rsc-anderlecht-give-their-opinion-on-what-happened-during-sundays-match/.

The [[Royal Belgian Football Association|RBFA]] condemned his behavior, the Belgian Foreign Minister [[Sophie Wilmès]] declared : "Unacceptable, unbearable and it has no place in our society. We must fight it as vigorously as all other forms of racism", political parties condemned the chant, while he was obliged by the [[Federal prosecutor's office (Belgium)|Federal prosecutor's office]] to visit the [[Kazerne Dossin Memorial, Museum and Documentation Centre|Kazern Dossin Centre]] as a disciplinary measure.<ref>"Noa Lang Undergoes Punishment and Visits Former Deportation Camp."
