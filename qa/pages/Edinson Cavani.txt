'''Edinson Roberto Cavani Gómez''' ({{IPA-es|ˈeðinsoŋ kaˈβani}}; born 14 February 1987) is a Uruguayan professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a striker for Spanish [[La Liga]] club [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] and the [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay national team]]. He is nicknamed ''El Matador'' ("The Killer") or ''Cazador'' ("Hunter") for his clinical finishing as well as his celebration, in which he makes a gesture resembling a [[bow and arrow]] . Cavani is widely considered one of the greatest strikers of his generation and one of Uruguay's best players.

Cavani began his career playing for [[Danubio F.C.|Danubio]] in Montevideo, where he played for two years, before moving to Italian side [[Palermo F.C.|Palermo]] in 2007. In 2010, Cavani signed for [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]], who signed him on an initial loan deal before buying him for a total fee of €17 million. He helped them win the [[2011–12 Coppa Italia|Coppa Italia]] in 2012 and established himself as the most dominant striker in [[Serie A]].<ref>{{cite web |last=O'Brien |first=Colin |title=Napoli's Edinson Cavani: Serie A's Most Wanted Striker |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1591104-napolis-edinson-cavani-serie-as-most-wanted-striker |access-date=31 May 2022 |website=Bleacher Report}}</ref> In mid-2013, Cavani joined [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] in France for a reported €64 million, at the time the most expensive signing in French football history.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ligue 1 - Cavani completes blockbuster £55.4m move to PSG - Yahoo!

He has participated in ten major international tournaments: four [[FIFA World Cup]]s ([[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]], [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022]]), five [[Copa América|Copas América]] ([[2011 Copa América|2011]], [[2015 Copa América|2015]], [[Copa América Centenario|2016]], [[2019 Copa América|2019]] and [[2021 Copa América|2021]]), and one [[FIFA Confederations Cup]] ([[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup|2013]]). Cavani scored at the 2010 World Cup to help Uruguay to fourth place in the tournament, and in 2011 was part of the Uruguay squad that won a record fifteenth Copa América title. He finished as the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|CONMEBOL 2018 World Cup qualification]] top scorer with ten goals.

He then started his Serie A tenure with Napoli scoring a controversial goal against Fiorentina after just seven minutes, with replays showing the ball landing on the line. Cavani also scored on his home debut against [[A.S. Bari|Bari]] before adding a late winner against [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]], meaning he had scored in his first four competitive matches with Napoli.

On 26 September, Cavani came on as a late replacement with 30 minutes left in a game against [[A.C. Cesena|Cesena]] which Napoli was losing 1–0. After assisting the equalising goal, he went on to score two more, with the scoreline finishing at 4–1. That meant Cavani shared the lead as top scorer in the league alongside [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]]'s [[Samuel Eto'o]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=304837&cc=5739&league=ITA.1|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120717015020/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=304837&cc=5739&league=ITA.1|url-status=dead|archive-date=17 July 2012|title=Cavani completes comeback|date=26 September 2010|work=ESPN Soccernet|access-date=30 September 2010}}</ref> Cavani's partnership with fellow forwards [[Ezequiel Lavezzi]] and [[Marek Hamšík]] led the Italian sporting media to dub them "The Three Tenors" after the famous [[The Three Tenors|singing group]] of the same name. On 15 December, Cavani netted a 92nd-minute goal against [[FC Steaua București|Steaua București]] to help his team to a 1–0 win and progress beyond the group stage of the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]]. In the first match, which was held on Romanian soil, he had scored an equalising goal in the 97th minute.

The incident received almost immediate and prominent international coverage from newspapers and the internet, mostly in defence of Cavani. Massive coverage included articles, columns, blogs, memes and cartoons.
