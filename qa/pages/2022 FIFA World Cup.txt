The '''2022 FIFA World Cup''' was the 22nd [[FIFA World Cup]], the quadrennial world championship for national [[association football|football]] teams organized by [[FIFA]]. It took place in [[Qatar]] from 20 November to 18 December 2022, after the country was awarded the hosting rights in 2010. It was the first World Cup to be held in the [[Arab world]] and [[Muslim world]], and the second held entirely in Asia after the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 tournament]] in South Korea and Japan.{{efn-ua|The [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 competition]] in Russia featured two Asian venues, according to various definitions of the [[Boundary between Asia and Europe|geographical boundary between Asia and Europe]]: [[Yekaterinburg]] and [[Sochi]].}}

This tournament was the last with 32 participating teams, with the number of teams being increased to 48 for the [[2026 FIFA World Cup|2026 edition]]. To avoid the extremes of [[Geography of Qatar#Climate|Qatar's hot climate]],{{efn-ua|Qatar has very high temperatures and is quite humid during summers.<ref name="auto5"/>}} the event was held during November and December.{{efn-ua|The tournament is the first not to be held in the traditional months of May, June, or July and take place in the northern autumn.<ref name="auto5">{{Cite news |last=Sullivan |first=Becky |date=18 November 2022 |title=Why Qatar is a controversial host for the World Cup |publisher=NPR |url=https://www.npr.org/2022/11/18/1137204271/qatar-world-cup-controversies |access-date=21 November 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last=Sanderson |first=Katharine |date=18 November 2022 |title=How will World Cup footballers cope with Qatar heat? |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-03771-9 |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=612 |issue=7938 |page=19 |doi=10.1038/d41586-022-03771-9 |pmid=36400953 |bibcode=2022Natur.612...19S |s2cid=253671490}}</ref>}} It was held over a reduced time frame of 29 days with 64 matches played in [[#Stadiums|eight venues]] across [[#Cities|five cities]].

It was Argentina's third title and their first since [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986]], as well being the first nation from outside of Europe to win the tournament since [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]. French player [[Kylian Mbappé]] became the first player to score a [[hat-trick]] in a World Cup final since [[Geoff Hurst]] in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 final]] and won the [[FIFA World Cup Golden Boot|Golden Boot]] as he scored the most goals (eight) during the tournament.

Qatar was the smallest nation by area ever to have been awarded a FIFA World Cup&nbsp;– the next smallest by area was Switzerland, host of the [[1954 FIFA World Cup|1954 World Cup]], which was more than three times as large as Qatar and only needed to host 16 teams instead of 32. Qatar also became only the second country (not including Uruguay and Italy, hosts of the first two World Cups) to be awarded a FIFA World Cup despite having never qualified for a previous edition: Japan was awarded co-hosting rights of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] in 1996 without ever having qualified for the finals, although they qualified for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 edition]]. Of the eight stadiums used in the tournament, six were located in the [[Doha]] metropolitan area, making it the first World Cup [[1930 FIFA World Cup|since 1930]] in which most of the stadiums were in one city. While this decreased the distance that fans and players needed to commute, Qatar itself struggled to accommodate the numbers of arriving fans with its diminutive amount of space.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/11/14/sports/qatar-world-cup-visitors.html |title=Qatar Faces a Tight Squeeze for Its Compact World Cup |website=The New York Times |date=14 November 2019 |access-date=1 April 2022}}</ref>

The most used stadium was the Lusail Stadium, which hosted 10 matches, including the final. The Al Bayt Stadium in Al Khor hosted nine matches. All but the nine matches hosted in Al Khor in this tournament were held within a {{convert|20|mile|km}} radius of the centre of Doha. In addition, the Khalifa, Al Thumama and Education City stadiums hosted eight matches each (Khalifa hosted the third place match, while Al Thumama and Education City hosted a quarter-final each) and the 974, Al Janoub and Ahmad bin Ali stadiums hosted seven matches each, including a round of 16 match each.

[[Stadium 974]], formerly known as the Ras Abu Aboud Stadium, was the seventh FIFA World Cup 2022 venue to be completed by the SC.

===Mascot===
{{main|La'eeb}}
The tournament's [[FIFA World Cup mascot|official mascot]] was unveiled on 1 April 2022, during the group stage draw. Its name is La{{hamza}}eeb ({{Lang-ar|لعيب|Laʿīb}}), which is an Arabic word meaning "super-skilled player". The official website of FIFA says: "La{{hamza}}eeb will be known for his youthful spirit; spreading joy and confidence everywhere he goes", and the official backstory of the character, published there, claims that it comes from a parallel world where tournament mascots live, "a world where ideas and creativity form the basis of characters that live in the minds of everyone".<ref>{{Cite web |title=La'eeb is revealed as Qatar's FIFA World Cup mascot |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/mens/worldcup/qatar2022/media-releases/laeeb-is-revealed-as-qatars-fifa-world-cup-tm-mascot |date=1 April 2022 |access-date=1 April 2022 |publisher=FIFA}}</ref> Social media commentary compared La'eeb's appearance to [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]] or the [[Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man]], or even the [[ghost]] of the construction workers who died building the stadiums and infrastructure.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://vietnam.postsen.com/trends/170049/Interesting-secrets-about-the-ghost-like-La%E2%80%99eeb-mascot-at-the-2022-World-Cup.html|title=Interesting secrets about the ghost-like La'eeb mascot at the 2022 World Cup|date=21 November 2022|website=Vietnam Posts English}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.news/2022-world-cup-laeeb-the-official-mascot-who-has-no-foot/|title=2022 World Cup: La'eeb, the official mascot who has no foot|date=7 October 2022|website=Time News}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://fastcompanyme.com/co-design/the-qatar-world-cup-mascot-design-is-inspired-bya-piece-of-traditional-arab-attire/|title=The Qatar World Cup mascot design is inspired by…a piece of traditional Arab attire}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://firstsportz.com/football-news-ghost-of-the-stadium-construction-workers-fans-take-a-dig-at-new-2022-fifa-world-cup-mascot/|title="Ghost of the stadium construction workers"- Fans take a dig at new 2022 FIFA World Cup mascot » FirstSportz|first=Soumyadeep|last=Mondal|date=21 November 2022|website=firstsportz.com}}</ref>

===Match ball===
{{Main|Adidas Al Rihla}}
[[File:Al-Rihla (cropped).jpg|thumb|''The adidas Al Rihla'']]
The official match ball, "Al Rihla", was unveiled on 30 March 2022. It was mainly inspired by the culture, architecture, iconic boats and flag of Qatar. In Arabic, the word ''Al Rihla'' ({{lang|ar|الْرِّحْلَة}} {{transliteration|ar|ar-riḥla}}) means "the journey". The ball was designed with sustainability as a priority, making it the first ever official match ball created with water-based glues and inks. As "the game is getting faster" and "speeds up",  the [[Adidas]] ball has internal electronic sensors, allowing detection of its speed and position, updated 500 times per second<ref>{{Cite web |title=Al Rihla by adidas revealed as FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Official Match Ball |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/mens/worldcup/qatar2022/media-releases/al-rihla-by-adidas-revealed-as-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022-tm-official-match |date=30 March 2022 |access-date=1 April 2022 |publisher=FIFA}}</ref> and it has to be charged before each game.<ref>{{Cite web |title='Al Rihla' Footballs Are the Most High-tech Ever Used in the World Cup as They Need To Be Charged Before the Games |url=https://www.sciencetimes.com/articles/41147/20221201/al-rihla-footballs-high-tech-used-world-cup-need-charged.htm |date=1 December 2022 |access-date=2 December 2022 |work=The Science Times}}</ref> Two of the match balls were sent and returned from space by FIFA and [[Qatar Airways]] on a [[SpaceX]] [[falcon 9]] [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|suborbital mission]] for promoting the world cup.<ref>{{Cite web |title=From Orbit To Kick-off {{!}} Starlink x FIFA |url=https://worldcup.starlink.com/ |access-date=2022-12-13 |website=worldcup.starlink.com |archive-date=13 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221213031114/https://worldcup.starlink.com/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The match ball for the [[2022 FIFA World Cup Final]] was announced on 11 December 2022. It is a variation of the Al Rihla named the ''Adidas Al Hilm'' ({{Lang-ar|الحلم|al-ḥulm|the dream}}, a reference to "every nation's dream of lifting the FIFA World Cup").<ref>{{Cite web |date=11 December 2022|title=adidas reveals the FIFA World Cup™ official Finals match ball|url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/mens/worldcup/qatar2022/media-releases/introducing-al-hilm-the-official-match-ball-of-the-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022-finals|access-date=11 December 2022|publisher=FIFA}}</ref>
Whilst the technical aspects of the ball are the same, the colour is different from the Al-Rihla balls used in the group stages and preceding knockout games, with a ''Gold Metallic'', maroon, ''Collegiate Burgundy'', and red design,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adidas.ae/en/al-hilm-pro-football/HC0437.html|title=Adidas Al Hilm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221211101720/https://www.adidas.ae/en/al-hilm-pro-football/HC0437.html|archive-date=11 December 2022|url-status=live}}</ref> a reference to the [[Flag of Qatar|national colors]] of host nation [[Qatar]] and the golden colors shared by the [[2022 FIFA World Cup Final|Final]]'s [[Lusail Stadium|venue]] and the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy]]. It is the fifth special ball for FIFA World Cup final matches, after the [[+Teamgeist Berlin]] ([[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|2006]]), [[Adidas Jabulani|Jo'bulani]] ([[2010 FIFA World Cup Final|2010]]), [[Adidas Brazuca|Brazuca Final Rio]] ([[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|2014]]), and [[Adidas Telstar 18|Telstar Mechta]] ([[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|2018]]).{{citation needed|date=December 2022}}

On October 23, 2022, an article published by ''[[The Guardian]]'' included statements from migrants working on the World Cup 2022 infrastructure.

After the [[Russian invasion of Ukraine]], Russia's participation was further thrown into doubt. On 24 February 2022, the three teams in Russia's [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA second round|qualifying path]] {{Emdash}} [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]], and [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] {{Emdash}} announced their unwillingness to play any matches in Russian territory.<ref>{{cite news |date=24 February 2022 |title=Statement |publisher=Polish Football Association |url=https://pzpn.pl/en/association/news/2022-02-24/statement |access-date=25 February 2022}}</ref> Poland and Sweden extended the boycott on 26 February to any qualifying games, and the Czech Republic made the same decision one day later.<ref>{{cite news |date=26 February 2022 |title=Poland does not intend to play the play-off match against Russia |publisher=Polish Football Association |url=https://pzpn.pl/en/national-teams/national-team-a/news/2022-02-26/poland-does-not-intend-to-play-the-play-off-match-against-russia |access-date=26 February 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=26 February 2022 |title=SvFF: herrlandslaget kommer inte att spela mot Ryssland |language=sv |trans-title=SvFF: the men's national team will not play against Russia |publisher=Swedish Football Association |url=https://svff.svenskfotboll.se/nyheter/2022/02/svff-herrlandslaget-kommer-inte-att-spela-mot-ryssland/ |access-date=26 February 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=27 February 2022 |title=Komuniké z mimořádného zasedání VV FAČR ze dne 27. 2. 2022 |language=cs |trans-title=Communiqué from the extraordinary meeting of the FAČR SC of 27 February 2022 |publisher=Czech Football Association |url=https://facr.fotbal.cz/komunike-z-mimoradneho-zasedani-vv-facr-ze-dne-27-2-2022/a15908/ |access-date=27 February 2022}}</ref>

On 27 February 2022, FIFA announced a number of sanctions impacting Russia's participation in international football. Russia was prohibited from hosting international competitions, and the national team was ordered to play all home matches [[Behind closed doors (sport)|behind closed doors]] in neutral countries. Under these sanctions, Russia would not be allowed to compete under the country's name, flag, or national anthem; similarly to the Russian athletes' participation in events such as the Olympics,<ref>{{cite news |date=19 February 2021 |title=Olympics: Russia to compete under ROC acronym in Tokyo as part of doping sanctions |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-2020-russia/olympics-russia-to-compete-under-roc-acronym-in-tokyo-as-part-of-doping-sanctions-idUSKBN2AJ1UZ |url-status=live |access-date=20 February 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210220020504/https://www.reuters.com/article/us-olympics-2020-russia/olympics-russia-to-compete-under-roc-acronym-in-tokyo-as-part-of-doping-sanctions-idUSKBN2AJ1UZ |archive-date=20 February 2021}}</ref> the team would compete under the abbreviation of their national federation, the [[Russian Football Union]] ("RFU"), rather than "Russia".<ref>{{cite web |date=27 February 2022 |title=Bureau of the FIFA Council takes initial measures with regard to war in Ukraine |url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/mens/worldcup/qatar2022/media-releases/bureau-of-the-fifa-council-takes-initial-measures-with-regard-to-war-in |access-date=27 February 2022 |publisher=FIFA}}</ref> The next day, FIFA decided to suspend Russia from international competitions "until further notice", including its participation in the 2022 FIFA World Cup.<ref>{{Cite news |last1=Roan|first1=Dan|last2=Stone|first2=Simon|date=28 February 2022|title=Fifa and Uefa suspend all Russian teams |work=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/athletics/60560567 |access-date=28 February 2022}}</ref>

===LGBT rights===
{{Main|LGBT issues at the 2022 FIFA World Cup}}
There are no [[LGBT rights in Qatar]], with homosexuality as well as campaigning for LGBT rights criminalized. As such, when Qatar was selected to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the choice to do so in a restrictive nation saw much criticism, with several topics becoming the subject of controversy. The security of fans,<ref>{{Cite news |last=MacInnes |first=Paul |date=8 November 2022 |title=Qatar World Cup ambassador criticised for 'harmful' homosexuality comments |website=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/08/qatar-world-cup-ambassador-homosexuality |access-date=29 November 2022}}</ref> as well as the homophobic football chants of certain nations, were points of discussion.<ref>{{cite news |date=1 December 2022 |title=FIFA abre nueva investigación a México por grito homofóbico |language=es |trans-title=FIFA opens a new investigation to Mexico over homophobic chant |work=Vanguardia de Veracruz |url=https://vanguardiaveracruz.com/fifa-abre-nueva-investigacion-a-mexico-por-grito-homofobico/ |access-date=1 December 2022}}</ref>

The main controversy came from a last-minute FIFA decision to hand out player punishments to European captains who had months earlier announced their intention to continue wearing rainbow-colored armbands (which began in 2020) in support of anti-discrimination; though not specifically in support of LGBT+ rights, nor targeting Qatar's lack, the rainbow symbol was deemed offensive to the hosts. Typically, kit violations incur a fine, which the teams had said they would pay; on the day of the first match involving one of the European teams, FIFA reportedly told the teams that they would receive a yellow card as a minimum.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Buckingham |first1=Philip |last2=Whitehead |first2=Jacob |date=23 November 2022 |title=Denmark ready to lead European withdrawal from FIFA over armband row |url=https://www.irishexaminer.com/sport/soccer/arid-41013320.html |access-date=24 November 2022 |website=Irish Examiner}}</ref>

Security officials at stadiums also confiscated items of rainbow clothing, flags featuring rainbows, whether [[Pride flag|Pride]]-related or not,<ref>{{Cite news |last=Delaney |first=Miguel |title=Fifa says rainbow colours are now allowed in Qatar after flags confiscated |website=Independent |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/fifa-rainbow-lgbtq-qatar-2022-b2232145.html |access-date=1 December 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |last=Church |first=Ben |date=28 November 2022 |title=Exclusive: World Cup soccer fans stopped by security officials for wearing rainbow-coloured items |website=CNN |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/26/football/german-soccer-fans-rainbow-colors-qatar-2022-world-cup-spt-intl/index.html |access-date=1 December 2022}}</ref> and reportedly intimidated fans.<ref>{{cite news |last=King |first=Jasper |date=30 November 2022 |title=England fan 'strip-searched' after wearing rainbow-coloured top and hat |work=Metro |url=https://metro.co.uk/2022/11/30/world-cup-england-fan-strip-searched-after-wearing-rainbow-clothes-17850629/}}</ref> American journalist [[Grant Wahl]] was briefly detained for wearing a t-shirt with a rainbow on it.<ref>{{Cite news |date=22 November 2022 |title=Rainbow-coloured clothing and items are causing a stir at the Qatar World Cup.

[[File:Iran national team fan 01.jpg|thumb|upright|An Iranian fan showing a banner with "[[Woman, Life, Freedom]]" slogan]]
Discrimination against women in Qatar was also criticized.<ref>{{cite news |date=17 November 2022 |title=FIFA World Cup: Why Qatar Is a Controversial Host |work=GreekReporter.com |url=https://greekreporter.com/2022/11/17/fifa-world-cup-qatar-controversial-host/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=4 November 2022 |title=FIFA rebuked over plea to World Cup teams to 'focus on football' in Qatar |publisher=France 24 |url=https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20221104-fifa-rebuked-over-plea-to-world-cup-teams-to-focus-on-football-in-qatar}}</ref> [[Women in Qatar]] have few freedoms,<ref>{{cite news |date=17 November 2022 |title=FIFA World Cup: Why Qatar Is a Controversial Host |work=GreekReporter.com |url=https://greekreporter.com/2022/11/17/fifa-world-cup-qatar-controversial-host/}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=4 November 2022 |title=FIFA rebuked over plea to World Cup teams to 'focus on football' in Qatar |language=en |work=France 24 |url=https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20221104-fifa-rebuked-over-plea-to-world-cup-teams-to-focus-on-football-in-qatar}}</ref> as they must obtain permission from their male guardians to marry, study abroad on government scholarships, work in many government jobs, travel abroad, receive certain forms of reproductive health care, and act as the primary guardian of children, even if they are divorced.<ref>{{cite news |date=29 March 2021 |title=Qatar: Male Guardianship Severely Curtails Women's Rights |language=en |work=Human Rights Watch |url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/03/29/qatar-male-guardianship-severely-curtails-womens-rights}}</ref>

Qatar attracted particular criticism for an incident where a Mexican employee of the World Cup Organizing Committee was accused of allegedly having [[Zina|sex outside of marriage]]. The woman had previously reported rape, while the male claimed to have been in a relationship with her, after which the woman was investigated for extramarital sex. Women in Qatar face the possible penalty of [[flagellation]] and a seven-year prison sentence if convicted for having sex outside of marriage. The criminal case was eventually dropped months after she was allowed to leave Qatar.<ref>{{Cite web |date=23 April 2022 |title=La mexicana acusada de adulterio en Qatar se libra de la prisión y los 100 latigazos |url=https://elpais.com/mexico/2022-04-03/la-mexicana-acusada-de-adulterio-en-qatar-se-libra-de-la-prision-y-los-100-latigazos.html |access-date=23 September 2022 |website=El Pais |language=es}}</ref>

===Influence of Iran===
In November 2022, there were reports suggesting that the government of [[Iran]] were working with Qatari officials to suppress anti-government protests at the 2022 FIFA World Cup,<ref name="auto7">{{Cite web |date=29 November 2022 |title='A major breach': How Iran is trying to use the World Cup to stifle protests |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/iran-regime-world-cup-qatar-b2235304.html |access-date=1 December 2022 |website=Independent }}</ref> in light of the [[Mahsa Amini protests]]. Leaked documents and audio clips suggested that Iranian government officials were in correspondence with Qatari authorities in order to handle possible protesters.<ref>{{Cite web |date=27 November 2022 |title=IRGC Man Says Qatar Helping Iran Silence Dissidents in World Cup |url=https://www.iranintl.com/en/202211279876 |access-date=1 December 2022 |website=Iran International }}</ref>

In November 2022, the Qatari government revoked the visas of journalists from a London-based Iranian news channel, [[Iran International]], known for being critical of the regime, who were seeking to cover the World Cup.<ref>{{Cite web |date=17 November 2022 |title=Journalists have Qatar World Cup visas 'revoked' after Iranian 'terrorist' designation |url=https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/broadcast/iran-international-television-qatar-world-cup-revoked/ |access-date=1 December 2022 |website=PressGazette }}</ref> On 21 November 2022, during the first group stage match from Group B, between Iran and England, attempts were reportedly made by the stadium's security forces to block Iranian fans who wore clothing or carried items bearing slogans that were deemed unsympathetic to the Islamic government of Iran.<ref>{{Cite web |date=25 November 2022 |title=Qatar 2022: World Cup staff confront Iran fan over Mahsa Amini shirt as Fifa begins cracking down on protests |url=https://inews.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup-security-staff-mahsa-amini-iran-shirt-woman-wales-1993684 |access-date=1 December 2022 |website=PressGazette }}</ref>  These included t-shirts and signs with "[[Woman, Life, Freedom]]" embedded onto them, Iran's previous flags, or any slogans containing the name of [[Death of Mahsa Amini|Mahsa Amini]].<ref>{{Cite web |date=16 September 2022 |title=Mahsa Amini: Woman dies after arrest by Iran's morality police |url=https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/9/16/iranian-woman-dies-after-moral-polices-detention-reports |access-date=1 December 2022 |publisher=Al Jazeera }}</ref> This crackdown continued throughout all of Iran's matches at the World Cup.<ref name="auto7"/> In addition to removing fans from stadiums, reports showed that officials tried to suppress any filming or photography of possible protests. In one case, Qatari police detained Danish TV presenter, Rasmus Tantholdt, for filming fans with "Woman, Life, Freedom" slogans, some of whom who had been earlier abused by a group of pro-government supporters.<ref>{{Cite web |date=4 November 2022 |title=Danish TV presenter 'detained by Qatari Police for filming Iranians under attack from pro-government mob' |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news/rasmus-tantholdt-detained-qatar-police-b2235829.html |access-date=1 December 2022 |website=Independent }}</ref>

===Alcohol ban===
As part of the Qatari bid, alcohol was to be permitted to be consumed around the stadiums. This was in contradiction to Qatari law which prohibits public consumption of alcohol and limits its consumption to high-end hotels. It was agreed that [[Budweiser]], FIFA's largest sponsor, would be permitted to sell their beer in designated areas in the stadium. Eight days before the tournament Qatari officials informed [[AB InBev]], the owners of Budweiser, that the beer tents were to be moved to less prominent areas and were no longer authorized inside the stadiums but still within the stadium perimeter.<ref name="New York Times">{{Cite news |last=Panja |first=Tariq |date=14 November 2022 |title=Qatar World Cup Faces New Edict: Hide the Beer |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/14/sports/soccer/world-cup-beer-fifa.html |access-date=19 November 2022}}</ref>

Two days before the tournament, on 18 November 2022, FIFA released a statement that sale points of beer would be removed from stadium perimeters in contradiction to both the Qatari bid and the earlier commitment when the sales were moved outside of the stadiums. FIFA's response was questioned as FIFA had forced recent World Cup hosts, such as Brazil, to change their laws to allow alcohol consumption at matches in line with sponsorship commitments.<ref name="BBC Sport"/> Alcohol was still permitted, however, inside the fan villages and inside the stadiums in the [[Luxury boxes|corporate hospitality boxes]], leading to claims of double standards.<ref name="Financial Times"/>

Regarding the last-minute Qatari ban on the sale of beer at the stadiums, Infantino proclaimed in his press conference: "I think personally, if for three hours a day you cannot drink a beer, you will survive."<ref>{{cite web |date=20 November 2022 |title=Explosive tirade from FIFA boss threatens to overshadow World Cup opener |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/19/football/gianni-infantino-press-conference-qatar-2022-world-cup-spt-intl/index.html |access-date=22 November 2022 |publisher=CNN}}</ref>

===Treatment of Jewish and Israeli visitors===
Qatar had previously promised to provide Jewish tourists with cooked [[Kashrut|''kosher'' food]] and public [[Prayer in Judaism|Jewish prayer services]] at the 2022 World Cup. However, shortly before the World Cup began, both were banned by Qatar, who claimed it could not secure the safety of Jews.<ref>{{cite AV media |date=23 November 2022 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuXU7fK3PGg |title=Qatar forcing Islamic laws on non-Muslims? Jews say prayers, Kosher food prohibited – report |publisher=[[Hindustan Times]] |via=[[YouTube]] |access-date=13 December 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221204204431/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuXU7fK3PGg |archive-date=4 December 2022 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=21 November 2022 |title=Qatar World Cup: Jewish organisation says kosher food and public prayer banned |url=https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/qatar-world-cup-report-kosher-food-jewish-prayer |website=[[Middle East Eye]]}}</ref>

Qatar alleged that they could not "secure" the safety of publicly praying Jewish tourists, whilst many foreign Jews complained that they subsequently had no food available to eat. It was estimated that 10,000 [[Israeli Jews|religious Jews from Israel]] and around the world arrived to watch the World Cup in Qatar.<ref name=":23">{{Cite news |last=Klein |first=Zvika |title=Qatar won't allow any cooked Kosher food and public Jewish prayer|url=https://www.jpost.com/international/article-722891 |access-date=19 November 2022 |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post &#124; Jpost.com}}</ref>

Whilst Jewish organisations complained of being unable to find cooked kosher food,<ref name=":23"/> the [[Government of Israel|Israeli government]] said it was happy with the efforts made by Qatar to meet its requests, including kosher food, direct flights from Israel to Qatar, and temporary diplomatic representation in the country. A kosher kitchen under the supervision of Rabbi [[Mendy Chitrik]] was open in time for the first match. Rabbi [[Marc Schneier]], president of [[The Foundation for Ethnic Understanding]], said he had never asked the Qatari government for cooked food, and he had been the only person in communication with the Qataris regarding making the World Cup experience inclusive for Jews.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jpost.com/diaspora/article-723281|title='All Israeli demands were met [by Qatar], including Kosher food' – sources|last1=Klein|first1=Zvika|website=The Jerusalem Post|date=24 November 2022|access-date=2 December 2022}}</ref>
