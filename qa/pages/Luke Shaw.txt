'''Luke Paul Hoare Shaw''' (born 12 July 1995) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[left-back]] for {{English football updater|ManchesU}} club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the [[England national football team|England national team]].

Originally a member of [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]]'s [[Southampton F.C. Under-23s and Academy|youth system]], Shaw made his first-team debut for the club in January 2012. He signed his first professional contract in May that year before becoming a regular in the Southampton team over the next two seasons. In June 2014, Shaw was signed by Manchester United for £30&nbsp;million, then a [[Transfer (association football)#Players|world record transfer fee]] for a teenager.

Shaw made his senior international debut for England in March 2014 in a 1–0 friendly win against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], and later that year was selected in the squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|FIFA World Cup]]. He scored his first international goal in the [[UEFA Euro 2020 final]], which was also the fastest scored in a [[UEFA European Championship]] final.
