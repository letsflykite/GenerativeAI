== Style of play ==
[[File:Argentina vs mexico enzofernandez.jpg|thumb|right|Fernández playing for Argentina at the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]]. Fernández has been noted for his ability to break up play and recycle possession.]]
Fernández usually plays as a [[Deep-lying playmaker|deep-seated playmaking]] [[central midfielder]], responsible for breaking up play, dictating the tempo, and recycling possession, while he is also a capable [[attacking midfielder]]. Although he prefers operating centrally, he can be seen occupying the left half-space assisted by a defensive midfield partner, like his former Benfica team-mate, [[Florentino Luís]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Analytical look at Chelsea’s record signing, Enzo Fernández |url=https://weaintgotnohistory.sbnation.com/2023/2/9/23592318/analytical-look-at-chelseas-record-signing-enzo-fernandez |archive-url=https://archive.is/oUetg |archive-date=9 Feb 2023 |date=9 Feb 2023 |work=We Ain't Got No History |last=Connolly |first=Martin}}</ref>

Fernández plays quick short passes, accurate long passes, and lobbed balls. He is combative in his midfield duels, protects spaces and his backline efficiently, possesses good passing range and vision. He can dribble into dangerous territory or out of it. He thrives in receiving the ball in tight spaces and is press-resistant. He is adept at breaking defensive lines with his passes, playing through balls, as well as recycling possession in the midfield. Out of possession, Fernández looks to proactively disrupt opposition attack, anticipate and intercept passes.<ref>{{cite news|title=Enzo Fernandez analysis: Benfica's creative prodigy taking Europe by storm |url=https://www.foottheball.com/players-in-focus/enzo-fernandez-stats-profile-river-plate-scout-report-transfer-news-analysis-potential/|date=18 September 2022|access-date=4 Feb 2023 |archive-date=9 Feb 2023 |archive-url=https://archive.is/pi0wg |website=foottheball.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://analyticsfc.co.uk/blog/2022/08/18/scouting-the-primeira-liga-the-next-players-to-make-the-step-up/|title=Scouting the Primeira Liga: The Next Players to Make the Step Up|date=18 August 2022|access-date=19 October 2022 |archive-url=https://archive.is/WEppm |archive-date=9 Feb 2023 |website=analyticsfc.co.uk}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://breakingthelines.com/player-analysis/enzo-fernandez-the-future-of-argentina-and-benficas-midfield/|title=Enzo Fernandez – The Future Of Argentina and Benfica's Midfield?|date=11 August 2022|access-date=19 October 2022 |archive-date=9 Feb 2023 |archive-url=https://archive.is/tAmTz |website=breakingthelines.com}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://themastermindsite.com/2022/10/10/analyzing-three-of-europes-most-promising-central-midfielders/|title=Analyzing three of Europe's most promising central midfielders|date=10 October 2022|access-date=19 October 2022 |archive-url=https://archive.is/E3D1c |archive-date=9 Feb 2023 |website=themastermindsite.com}}</ref>
