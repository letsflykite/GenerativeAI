==Club career==
===Bethlehem Steel===

===Philadelphia Union===
On September 17, 2018, it was announced that Aaronson would join the [[Philadelphia Union]] at the beginning of their 2019 season.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.philadelphiaunion.com/post/2018/09/17/union-sign-midfielder-brenden-aaronson-club-s-sixth-current-homegrown-player|title=Union Sign Midfielder Brenden Aaronson As Club's Sixth Current Homegrown Player &#124; Philadelphia Union|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180917215243/https://www.philadelphiaunion.com/post/2018/09/17/union-sign-midfielder-brenden-aaronson-club-s-sixth-current-homegrown-player|archive-date=September 17, 2018}}</ref> On March 17, 2019, the homegrown player scored his first professional goal in his MLS debut, helping Philadelphia tie against [[Atlanta United]].

At the end of his rookie season, Aaronson finished second for 2019 MLS Rookie of the year, with three goals and two assists in over 1,640 minutes played.
