Following the match, Neuer revealed that he studied the way Ronaldo took his penalties. Neuer told Bild: "I always prepare myself for such situations. Our goalkeeping coach, Toni Tapalović, showed me on his laptop before the match how Ronaldo usually takes his penalties. I learned that Ronaldo prefers to send the ball low to his left.

== International career ==

=== Youth ===
After progressing through the youth teams, Neuer made his [[Germany national under-21 football team|Germany under-21]] debut on 15 August 2006 against the [[Netherlands national under-21 football team|Netherlands]]. He won the 2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship with Germany in [[Sweden]] and kept a clean sheet in the 4–0 win in the final against [[England national under-21 football team|England]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/under21/season=2009/matches/round=15089/match=2001198/index.html|title=Germany-England &#124; Under-21|website=UEFA.com}}</ref>

The death of keeper [[Robert Enke]] in November 2009 saw him elevated to second choice goalkeeper behind [[René Adler]]. Adler, however, suffered a serious rib injury which ruled him out of the upcoming [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]]; Neuer became Germany's first choice goalkeeper ahead of [[Tim Wiese]] and [[Hans-Jörg Butt]] for the tournament.<ref>{{cite news|title=Lahm to Skipper Germany at World Cup; Neuer is Keeper|url=http://sify.com/news/lahm-to-skipper-germany-at-world-cup-neuer-is-keeper-news-international-kf2sOcifbbg.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706020038/http://sify.com/news/lahm-to-skipper-germany-at-world-cup-neuer-is-keeper-news-international-kf2sOcifbbg.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=6 July 2010|website=Sify News|date=28 May 2010 | access-date = 24 January 2014}}</ref>

Neuer played every minute of every match in the [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying|qualification]] campaign for [[UEFA Euro 2012]], helping Germany to secure ten wins out of ten games and top their [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying Group A|group]]. After Germany's 3–1 away win against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]], he was especially praised for his "sensational" performance.{{citation needed|date=January 2022}} He retained a close range volley shot by [[Hamit Altıntop]], and then he quickly threw the ball to the halfway line into the feet of [[Thomas Müller]], who immediately provided the assist for [[Mario Gómez]]'s opening goal. Neuer then set up the second goal; under pressure by Turkish attackers, he fired a precise long range kick to [[Mario Götze]] deep in the opponent's half, who then found Müller on the edge of the opponent's penalty box to score.<ref>{{cite news | title = Manuel Neuer begeistert sogar seine Gegner | work = Die Welt | date = 8 October 2011 | url=https://www.welt.de/sport/fussball/em-2012/article13649140/Manuel-Neuer-begeistert-sogar-seine-Gegner.html | access-date =8 November 2011| last1 = Krull | first1 = Patrick }}</ref> Neuer started all three of Germany's matches in the oft-dubbed "[[UEFA Euro 2012 Group B|Group of Death]]", Group B. He kept a clean sheet against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] while also conceding one goal each to the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] and [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]]. Germany went on to win Group B; they were the only team in the tournament to win all of their group stage games. He finished group play posting two saves against Portugal, three against the Netherlands and three again against Denmark.{{citation needed|date=June 2020}}

Neuer's "sweeper-keeper" playing style distinguished him from other starting goalkeepers in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]]. This was credited with allowing his teammates to press deep in their opponents' half; in addition, Neuer's willingness to come out and challenge opposing attackers caused them to miss shots.<ref name="The Score">{{cite web|url=http://www.thescore.ie/manuel-neuer-world-cup-2014-1564873-Jul2014/ |title=Why Manuel Neuer was the best player at the 2014 World Cup |publisher=The Score |date=14 July 2014 |access-date=16 July 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140728195121/http://www.thescore.ie/manuel-neuer-world-cup-2014-1564873-Jul2014/ |archive-date=28 July 2014 }}</ref> Neuer's outfield roaming, which had made him the team's "11th man", has been attributed to the coaching he received from Bayern Munich manager [[Pep Guardiola]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/these-football-times/2014/jul/16/manuel-neuer-germany-revolutionising-goalkeeping-world-cup-bayern-munich | title = How Manuel Neuer, Germany's 11th man, is revolutionising goalkeeping | work = The Guardian | date = 16 July 2014 | access-date = 16 July 2014 | first = Paddy | last = Vipond}}</ref>

After keeping clean sheets in group matches against Portugal and the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], Neuer had an outstanding performance in a 2–1 win against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] after extra time in the round of 16, when he had to play as a sweeper-keeper to defend their counter-attacks.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.welt.de/sport/gallery129636661/Die-Ausfluege-des-Manuel-Neuer-gegen-Algerien.html |title=Die Ausflüge des Manuel Neuer gegen Algerien |website=Die Welt |language=de |date=2014 }}</ref> He recorded his third clean sheet of the World Cup in the 1–0 [[2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Quarter-finals|quarter-final]] defeat of [[France national football team|France]].

On 13 July, in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup Final|FIFA World Cup Final]] against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], Neuer was not heavily tested, but he nonetheless commanded his penalty area well, challenging attacking runs by [[Gonzalo Higuaín]] and [[Rodrigo Palacio]] that caused them to shoot wide of the net. Early in the second half, Neuer punched the ball clear before colliding with Higuaín at the edge of the box. Argentina finished the match without a shot on goal, despite several good chances, including a Higuaín goal disallowed for offside.<ref name="The Score"/> Germany ultimately defeated Argentina 1–0 thanks to a Mario Götze goal in extra time.

=== Euro 2016 ===
On 31 May 2016, Neuer was selected for Germany's final 23 man squad for [[UEFA Euro 2016]]. During the tournament, Neuer did not concede any goals during Germany's three group games against [[Ukraine national football team|Ukraine]], [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Northern Ireland national football team|Northern Ireland]]. He also kept a clean sheet in the round of 16 against [[Slovakia national football team|Slovakia]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Germany have yet to concede at EURO 2016|url=http://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=2386292.html|publisher=UEFA|language=en | date = 29 June 2016 | access-date = 29 June 2016}}</ref> During the quarter-finals, on 2 July 2016, he finally conceded a goal against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] from a [[Leonardo Bonucci]] penalty kick; Neuer established a new record by not conceding a goal in a major tournament for 557 minutes. The previous record-holder was his compatriot Sepp Maier, who did not concede a goal for 481 minutes. A 1–1 draw after extra-time saw the match go to a penalty shoot-out, in which Neuer helped Germany to a 6–5 victory by saving two spot kicks, including one from Bonucci. Neuer was named ''Man of the Match'' for his performance.<ref>{{cite web|title=Man of the Match' Neuer sets record|url=https://fcbayern.com/en/news/2016/07/news-in-brief-030716|publisher=FC Bayern Munich|language=en | date = 3 July 2016 | access-date = 3 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2016/jul/02/germany-italy-euro-2016-live|title=Germany 1–1 Italy|work=The Guardian|author1=Rob Smyth|date=2 July 2016|access-date=2 July 2016}}</ref>

During this time, Neuer was a part of a collaboration between the [[German Football Association]] and [[The LEGO Group]], who in May 2016 released a Europe-exclusive [[Lego Minifigures (theme)|collectible minifigure series]], with Neuer featured as the second of sixteen [[minifigure]]s in the collection.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.lego.com/en-my/aboutus/news/2019/november/new-lego-dfb-minifigure-series |title= This squad will be playing for the LEGO Minifigure Series "DFB – Die Mannschaft" |author=Lego Group |date= 12 April 2016 |website= Lego.com |publisher= Lego |access-date= 28 March 2022}}</ref>

Considered by some in the media to be the current best goalkeeper in the world, and one of the greatest goalkeepers both of his generation and of all time, Neuer is widely regarded as a "complete" and modern goalkeeper. He is regarded by some pundits to be the best goalkeeper of the modern era, with Peter Staunton of ''[[Goal.com]]'' labelling him as "the best goalkeeper since [[Lev Yashin|Yashin]]," who is currently the only goalkeeper ever to have won the [[Ballon d'Or]].{{refn|name="playing-style"|group="nb"}}{{#tag:ref|See<ref name="newrepublic_1"/><ref name="evolution2"/><ref name="thescore2"/><ref name="ESPN Profile"/><ref name="more than a sweeper"/><ref name="best in his position" /><ref name="Neuer"/><ref name="world's best goalkeeper"/><ref name="best goalkeeper in the world"/><ref name="Neuer is best in the world by far"/><ref name="Neuer takes goalkeeping to spectacular levels"/><ref name="WORLD'S BEST GOALKEEPER 2016"/><ref name="Is Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer the best goalkeeper ever"/><ref name="Anatomy of a goalkeeper"/><ref name="Awards"/><ref name="Neuer is the best goalkeeper since Yashin"/><ref name="auto3"/><ref name="auto4"/><ref name="auto1"/><ref name="auto5"/><ref name="auto2"/><ref name="auto"/>|group="nb"}}

A tall, large, athletic, and physically strong player, Neuer has earned critical acclaim from former players and pundits for his speed, stamina, composure, concentration, consistency, and mentality, as well as for being able to adapt to any given situation on the pitch. He is particularly known for his exceptional reflexes, shot-stopping abilities (with both his arms and legs), agility, speed, and footwork, as well as his handling, capacity to read the game, and ability to come out to collect crosses, which enables him to command his area effectively. When the situation demands, he will also often essentially fill the role of a sweeper when opposing players have beaten the offside trap or his team's defensive line by quickly rushing out of goal to anticipate opponents and clear the ball; his skill, speed and decision-making in this area enables his teams to maintain a high defensive line. Because of his unique playing style, Neuer has been described as a "sweeper-keeper", and has been credited with revolutionising the role of the goalkeeper in modern times. He has also been praised by pundits for his positioning between the posts, as well as his ability in one-on-one situations; furthermore, he is effective at stopping penalties, and has also been known to take and score them in shoot-outs.{{refn|name="playing-style"|group="nb"}}

A former outfield player in his youth, in addition to his goalkeeping ability, Neuer has also been praised for his excellent ball control and for his accurate distribution of the ball with both his hands and feet; his long throwing range and ability to kick the ball into deep areas with either foot enables him to play the ball out on the ground or create plays or launch swift counter-attacks from the back. Regarding his technical skills on the ball in comparison to other players in his role, Neuer has stated that he could play in the German third division as a centre-back if so desired. Due to his authoritative leadership and vocal presence in goal, he also excels at communicating with his defenders and organising his team's defensive line.{{refn|name="playing-style"|group="nb"}} In 2015, [[Gianluigi Buffon]] described Neuer as the best goalkeeper of his era in the air.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://90min.com/posts/2732836-gianluigi-buffon-names-arsenal-s-petr-cech-as-the-best-goalkeeper-of-his-era|title=Gianluigi Buffon Names Arsenal's Petr Cech as the Best Goalkeeper of his Era|publisher=90min|author=Mahmoud Jaber|date=19 November 2015|access-date=8 February 2019}}</ref>

Despite the praise for his style of play and role in the development of the goalkeeper position in football, Neuer has also received criticism in the German media for his reflex-like objection to attacking moves in his box regardless of whether they violate rules or not. In particular, his tendency to instantaneously raise his arm to alert the referee has led to the creation of the German word ''Reklamierarm'' (roughly translated: arm of objection) in German media.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.welt.de/sport/fussball/bundesliga/fc-bayern-muenchen/article146217458/Der-ewige-Reklamierarm-von-Manuel-Neuer.html|title=Torwart-Reflex: Der ewige Reklamierarm von Manuel Neuer|first=Lars|last=Wallrodt| language = de | date = 10 September 2015 |access-date = 29 May 2019 | newspaper = Die Welt}}</ref>

After an erroneous translation of his statement "it would be good if a professional football player [[Coming out|came out]] because it would help others to do the same", a South American publication concluded that he was gay, which was taken up by many other media outlets and has since been widely believed in some Latin American countries.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2011/may/03/manuel-neuer-schalke-manchester-united | title = Love of Jens Lehmann has Manuel Neuer ready to rock Manchester United | website = The Guardian | date = 3 May 2011 | access-date = 21 June 2018 | first = Marcus | last = Christenson}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://planoinformativo.com/planodeportivo/68547/manuel-neuer-se-declara-homosexual | title = Manuel Neuer se declara homosexual | language = es | website = planoinformativo.com | date = 2 September 2013 | access-date = 21 June 2018}}</ref> Mexico were fined for their fans' homophobic chants when Neuer had the ball during a [[2018 FIFA World Cup Group F#Germany vs Mexico|World Cup match in 2018]].<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jun/18/puto-chants-mexico-football-world-cup | title = 'Homophobic and not very clever': why puto chants haunt Mexican football | website = The Guardian | date = 18 June 2018 | access-date = 21 June 2018 | first = Victor | last = Balta}}</ref>
