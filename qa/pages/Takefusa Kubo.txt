At the age of seven, Takefusa Kubo started playing football for FC Persimmon, then moved to a local club based in his home city [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]]. In August 2009, he was awarded MVP at FC Barcelona Soccer Camp<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kaptivasportsexperience.com/|title=Kaptiva Sports Experience football|website=Kaptiva Sports Experience|language=en-GB|access-date=24 August 2019|archive-date=2 April 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402151859/https://kaptivasportsexperience.com/|url-status=dead}}</ref> in which he participated at the age of eight. In April 2010, he was selected as a member of FC Barcelona School team and participated in Sodexo European Rusas Cup held in Belgium. He was awarded MVP even though his team finished third.
