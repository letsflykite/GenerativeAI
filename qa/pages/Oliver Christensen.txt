'''Oliver Christensen''' (born 22 March 1999) is a Danish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{German football updater|HerthaBe}} club [[Hertha BSC]], and the [[Denmark national football team|Denmark national team]].

==Club career==
===OB===
Born in [[Kerteminde]] on the island of [[Funen]], Christensen played in the youth department of his local club, Kerteminde Boldklub, before moving to [[Odense Boldklub]] (OB) at under-12 level. There, he progressed through the academy, and completed a trial with [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in October 2016.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Dupont |first1=Nicolai |title=OB-talent på besøg i Manchester United |url=https://www.tipsbladet.dk/nyhed/superliga/ob-talent-paa-besoeg-i-manchester-united |work=Tipsbladet.dk |date=17 October 2016 |language=da}}</ref>

In May 2017, Christensen signed a three-year professional contract with OB, and was promoted to the first team. Thus, he became a part of the club until 2020.<ref name="ob1">{{cite web |last1=Wamsler |first1=Morten |title=OB og Oliver Christensen laver tre-årig aftale |url=http://v3.ob.dk/artikel/ob-og-oliver-christensenlaver-tre-aarig-aftale.aspx |website=ob.dk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181030035531/http://v3.ob.dk/artikel/ob-og-oliver-christensenlaver-tre-aarig-aftale.aspx |archive-date=30 October 2018 |language=da |date=22 May 2017}}</ref> In the first year of his contract, he still attended classes, after which he would become a full-time professional from the summer of 2018.<ref name="ob1" />

He made his professional debut on 22 October 2018 in a [[Danish Superliga]] match against [[Brøndby IF]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Forbilledlig fight gav point på Brøndby Stadion |url=https://www.ob.dk/nyhedsarkiv/forbilledlig-fight-gav-point-paa-broendby-stadion/ |website=ob.dk |language=da |date=22 October 2018}}</ref> He impressed during the match, fending off a number of shots on goal from opposing players.<ref>{{cite news |title=19-årig OB-målmand efter drømmedebut: Kan takke BIFs fans for ikke at have nogen stemme de næste tre dage |url=https://www.tv3sport.dk/sport/fodbold/nyheder/19-arig-ob-malmand-efter-drommedebut-kan-takke-bi-fs-fans-for-ikke-at-have-nogen-stemme-de-naeste-tre-dage |work=TV3 SPORT |date=23 October 2018 |language=da}}</ref> He since became established as the starting goalkeeper for OB, gaining the nickname ''Gribben fra Kerteminde'', meaning "the vulture from [[Kerteminde]]" due to his large [[wingspan]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Jørgensen |first1=Sune |title=OB-målmand afslører: Derfor bliver jeg kaldt Gribben fra Kerteminde |url=https://www.tv2fyn.dk/kerteminde/ob-maalmand-afsloerer-derfor-bliver-jeg-kaldt-gribben-fra-kerteminde |work=TV2 Fyn |date=13 November 2020 |language=da}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Halkier |first1=Emil |title=Der er sket lidt siden dengang Gribben fra Kerteminde delte aviser ud i nabolaget |url=https://www.dr.dk/sporten/fodbold/landsholdet/der-er-sket-lidt-siden-dengang-gribben-fra-kerteminde-delte-aviser-ud-i |work=DR |date=12 November 2020 |language=da}}</ref>

===Hertha BSC===
On 26 August 2021, Christensen was sold to [[Bundesliga]] club [[Hertha BSC]], where he signed a deal until June 2026.<ref>[https://www.herthabsc.com/de/nachrichten/2021/08/transfer-oliver-christensen-2122 HERTHA BSC VERPFLICHTET OLIVER CHRISTENSEN], herthabsc.com, 26 August 2021</ref> On 5 November, he made his debut for the reserve team [[Hertha BSC II]] in the [[Regionalliga Nordost]] game against [[1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Hertha BSC II vs. Lokomotive Leipzig - 5 November 2021 - Soccerway |url=https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2021/11/05/germany/regionalliga/hertha-bsc-berlin-ii/1-fc-lokomotive-leipzig/3528383/ |website=int.soccerway.com |access-date=11 November 2021}}</ref> During the [[2021–22 Hertha BSC season|2021–22 season]] he did not make any Bundesliga appearance, as [[Alexander Schwolow]] and [[Marcel Lotka]] were given preference. Hertha finished the season in 16th place in the table and would thus meet [[Hamburger SV]] in playoffs for relegation and promotion. Since Lotka and Schwolow were injured, Christensen played both games and was able to keep Hertha in the Bundesliga.<ref>{{cite news |title=Lotka fehlt Hertha auch in Hamburg |url=https://www.kicker.de/lotka-fehlt-hertha-auch-in-hamburg-903101/artikel |access-date=21 June 2022 |work=kicker |date=21 May 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220531210113/https://www.kicker.de/lotka-fehlt-hertha-auch-in-hamburg-903101/artikel |archive-date=31 May 2022 |language=de-DE}}</ref>

==International career==
Christensen played two games each for the [[Denmark national under-18 football team|Denmark under-18 team]] in 2017 and for the [[Denmark national under-19 football team|under-19 team]] in 2017 and 2018, respectively. After gaining a cap for the [[Denmark national under-20 football team|under-20]] side in 2019, Christensen made his debut for the [[Denmark national under-21 football team|under-21 team]] on 10 September 2019 in a 2–1 victory in the [[2021 UEFA European Under-21 Championship qualification]] match against [[Romania national under-21 football team|Romania]] in [[Aalborg]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Oliver Christensen drømmer om at komme til EM |url=https://www.ob.dk/nyhedsarkiv/oliver-christensen-droemmer-om-at-komme-til-em/ |website=ob.dk |language=da |date=6 November 2019}}</ref>

On 9 November 2020, Christensen was called up to [[Kasper Hjulmand]]'s senior squad for the [[Exhibition game|friendly]] against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] due to several cancellations from, among others, the Danish national team players playing in England, due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in England|COVID-19 restrictions]], as well as a case of [[Coronavirus disease 2019|COVID-19]] in the squad, which had put several national team players in quarantine. He started the match against Sweden at [[Brøndby Stadium]] in his debut match, on 11 November 2020.<ref>{{cite news |title=Wind og Bah sikrer dansk 2-0 sejr over Sverige |url=https://dbu.dk/nyheder/2020/november/wind-og-bah-sikrer-dansk-2-0-sejr-over-sverige/ |accessdate=12 November 2020 |work=[[Danish Football Association]] |date=11 November 2020 |language=Danish }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Jørgensen |first1=Sune |title=Debut på landsholdet: OB-målmand starter inde mod Sverige |url=https://www.tv2fyn.dk/odense/debut-paa-landsholdet-ob-maalmand-starter-inde-mod-sverige |work=TV2 Fyn |date=11 November 2020 |language=da}}</ref>
