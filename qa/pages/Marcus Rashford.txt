'''Marcus Rashford''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|MBE}} (born 31 October 1997) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for {{English football updater|ManchesU}} club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the [[England national football team|England national team]].

A product of the Manchester United youth system, he joined the club at the age of seven. Rashford scored two goals on both his first-team and European debut against [[FC Midtjylland|Midtjylland]] in the [[UEFA Europa League]] in February 2016 and his Premier League debut against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] three days later. He also scored in his first [[Manchester derby]], as well as on his [[EFL Cup]] and [[UEFA Champions League]] debuts. With United, Rashford has won the [[FA Cup]], two EFL Cups, the [[FA Community Shield]] and the UEFA Europa League.

Rashford scored on his England debut in May 2016, becoming the youngest English player to score in his first senior international match. He has since appeared at two [[UEFA European Championship]]; [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016]], where he was the tournament's youngest player, and [[UEFA Euro 2020|2020]], where he appeared in the [[UEFA Euro 2020 Final|Final]] as England finished runners-up to [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. He has also represented England at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup]].

Rashford has been praised for using his platform to be a political activist and philanthropist to drive societal change. He is a campaigner against [[Racism in the United Kingdom|racism]], [[Homelessness in the United Kingdom|homelessness]] and [[Hunger in the United Kingdom#Among children|child hunger]] in the United Kingdom. He has been recognised for his efforts by organisations both within and outside of sport, and was subject of a [[Mural of Marcus Rashford|mural]] painted by [[street art]]ist Akse in [[Withington]].
