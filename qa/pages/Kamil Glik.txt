==Club career==
===Early career===
Glik began his career in the youth ranks of ''MOSiR Jastrzębie Zdrój'' and [[Wodzisław Śląski|WSP Wodzisław Śląski]], then moved on loan to ''LKS Silesia Lubomia''.

On 6 August 2008, he signed a four-year contract with Polish top division side [[Piast Gliwice]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.sport.pl/pilka/1,65029,5561514.html | title = Nowy piłkarz Piasta Gliwice z...

Subsequently, he became a regular in the team's starting eleven. He played 26 games in his first season with the club, and he scored 2 goals in 28 games in the 2009–10 season.

===Palermo===
At the end of the season it was reported that he had begun talks with Italian side [[U.S. Città di Palermo]];<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11865_6244757,00.html | title = Glik considers Palermo move | date = 4 July 2010 | work = SkySports.com | access-date = 4 July 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.corrieredellosport.it/mondiali_2010/girone_e/danimarca/2010/07/04-119112/Sabatini%3A+%C2%ABKjaer+parte%C2%BB.+Palermo,+arriva+Glik | title = Sabatini: "Kjaer parte" Palermo, arriva Glik | date = 4 July 2010 | work = Corriere dello Sport | access-date = 4 July 2010 | language = it | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120229181358/http://www.corrieredellosport.it/mondiali_2010/girone_e/danimarca/2010/07/04-119112/Sabatini:+%C2%ABKjaer+parte%C2%BB.+Palermo,+arriva+Glik | archive-date = 29 February 2012 | url-status = dead }}</ref> on 7 July 2010 he signed with Sicilian club, who purchased him outright on a five-year contract.

====Bari (loan)====
A few days before the official reopening of the transfer market, Palermo granted an exemption and allowed him to train – with a recovery date set for 28 December – with his new team, [[S.S.C. Bari|Bari]].<ref>{{cite news| url = http://www.90minut.pl/news/143/news1434661-Kamil-Glik-zawodnikiem-AS-Bari.html | title = Kamil Glik zawodnikiem AS Bari| date = 28 December 2010 | publisher= 90minut.pl | access-date = 28 December 2010 | language = pl}}</ref> He moved to Bari until the end of season, strongly backed by the coach [[Giampiero Ventura]].
