He has won twenty-three major trophies at Real Madrid, including five [[UEFA Champions League]] titles, three [[La Liga]] titles, two [[Copa del Rey]] titles, four [[Supercopa de España]] titles, four [[UEFA Super Cup]] titles and five [[FIFA Club World Cup]] titles. He won the [[La Liga Awards|La Liga Award]] for "Best Midfielder" in 2016 for the second time, and the [[UEFA Club Football Awards#Best Midfielder|UEFA Club Football Award]] for "Best Midfielder" in 2017 and 2018.

In 2018, Modrić became the first Croatian player to win the [[UEFA Men's Player of the Year Award]], and by winning [[The Best FIFA Men's Player]] and [[Ballon d'Or]] awards, he became the first player other than [[Messi–Ronaldo rivalry|Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo]] to claim the awards in more than a decade. In 2019, he was awarded the [[Golden Foot]] award for career results and personality.

Modrić made his international debut for Croatia against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in March 2006, and scored his first international goal in a friendly match against [[Italy national football team|Italy]].

At the Euro 2008, he was selected for the [[UEFA Euro 2008#UEFA Team of the Tournament|Team of the Tournament]], becoming only the second Croatian to ever achieve this honour. Following group stage eliminations in his first two World Cups, Modrić led Croatia to the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|2018 World Cup Final]], winning the [[FIFA World Cup Golden Ball|Golden Ball]] in process.

Modrić had a slow start at Tottenham.

After the appointment of manager [[Harry Redknapp]], Modrić was given a more familiar role as a central or left-sided midfielder, allowing him to have more influence on the team and use his footballing talent more productively, for example in a 4–4 draw with [[North London derby|arch-rivals]] Arsenal on 29 October.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/7684610.stm |title=Arsenal 4–4 Tottenham |first=Phil |last=McNulty |date=29 October 2008 |work=BBC Sport |access-date=11 May 2011}}</ref> Redknapp recognised Modrić's value to his side and planned to shape his new team around the Croatian playmaker.

Before the [[2009–10 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2009–10 season]], Redknapp said of Modrić, "[He's] a hell of a player and a manager's dream, so I am told. He trains like a demon and never complains, will work with and without the ball on the field and can beat a defender with a trick or with a pass.
