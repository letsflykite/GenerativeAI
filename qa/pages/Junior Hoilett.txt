'''David Wayne Hoilett Jr.''' (born 5 June 1990), known as '''Junior Hoilett''', is a Canadian professional [[Association football|soccer]] player who most recently played as a [[winger (association football)|left winger]] for [[EFL League One]] club [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] and who plays for the [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada national team]].

After impressing in a youth tournament, Hoilett signed for English club [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] at the age of 13, and was loaned to [[SC Paderborn 07|SC Paderborn]] and [[FC St. Pauli]] in the German [[2. Bundesliga]] due to work permit issues. He made his Rovers debut in 2009 and played three full [[Premier League]] seasons for them before a transfer to [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] in 2012. Hoilett spent four years at the [[Loftus Road]] club – alternately in the Premier League and [[EFL Championship|Championship]] – before moving to Cardiff on the expiration of his contract. In his second season with Cardiff, he helped the side win promotion to the Premier League by finishing as Championship runners-up during the [[2017–18 Cardiff City F.C. season|2017–18 season]].

Hoilett made his senior international debut for [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] in 2015. He was part of their squad at the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]] in [[2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2017]], [[2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2019]], [[2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2021]] and [[2023 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2023]], reaching the semi-finals of the 2021 tournament.

After moving to England, he attended [[St Bede's Roman Catholic High School, Blackburn|St Bede's Roman Catholic High School]] in [[Blackburn]].<ref name=lancs/><ref>{{cite news |title=Premier League Under 16 Schools' Cup for Girls' Final |url=http://www.esfa.co.uk/news/?2015/04/28/094110/premier-league-under-16-schools-cup-for-girls-final |access-date=22 January 2019 |publisher=English Schools Football Association |date=28 April 2015}}</ref>

==Club career==
He progressed through Blackburn's youth system before signing his first contract at the age of 16. However, he suffered a setback when he was initially unable to earn a work permit to play in the United Kingdom. In order to qualify for one in future, Blackburn looked to loan Hoilett to a club in another European country, with the player rejecting possible moves to Belgium and France.<ref name=lancs/>

Hoilett eventually agreed to a loan move to Germany, joining [[SC Paderborn 07|SC Paderborn]]. He made his senior debut for the club against [[Kickers Offenbach]], coming on as a [[substitute (association football)|substitute]] for [[Sven Lintjens]] in a 3–2 victory on 3 February 2008, aged 17.<ref name="Zwei Aussetzer in der Defensive">{{cite news
