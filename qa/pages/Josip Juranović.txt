==Club career==
Born in [[Zagreb]], Croatia, Juranović went through the ranks of the third-tier [[NK Dubrava|Dubrava]], apart from a two-month stint at the nearby [[NK Croatia Sesvete]] academy. Making his third-level senior debut in the 2012–13 season, he first drew attention to himself by winning the Croatian leg of the [[Nike Academy|Nike Chance]] competition for amateur players in early 2014, earning the right to vie for a spot in the [[Nike Academy]] team.<ref>[http://www.nkdubrava.hr/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=234:2014-03-05-josip-juranovic-jopa-pobjednik-projekta-nike-chance-2014&catid=94&Itemid=1202 2014.03.05. - Josip Juranović Jopa - pobjednik projekta Nike Chance 2014.] at [[NK Dubrava|Dubrava]] official site</ref> Not making the five-person cut,<ref>[http://news.nike.com/news/winners-of-nike-s-the-chance-global-showcase-announced-at-st-george-s-park Winners of Nike Chance Global Showcase Announced at St George's Park] at [[Nike, Inc.]] official site</ref> however, he returned to his club. His club performances remained strong, and, touted by some media as the best player of the autumn leg of the 2014–15 [[Treća HNL|Treća HNL Zapad]],<ref>[http://www.jutarnji.hr/pojacanje-iz-trece-lige-josip-juranovic-iz-dubrave-sljedeceg-tjedna-potpisuje-za-hajduk/1253357/ POJAČANJE IZ TREĆE LIGE Josip Juranović iz Dubrave potpisuje za Hajduk: 'To je prilika života'] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212415/http://www.jutarnji.hr/pojacanje-iz-trece-lige-josip-juranovic-iz-dubrave-sljedeceg-tjedna-potpisuje-za-hajduk/1253357/ |date=3 March 2016 }} at [[Jutarnji List]]</ref><ref>[http://www.sportnews-hr.info/3-hnl/3-hnl-zapad/vijesti/2194-j-juranovic-najbolji-zagrebacki-amater-jos-malo-u-dubravi-pa-gore.html J.
