==Player profile==
<!-- === Style of play === -->
Having occupied several positions, Enrique was most noted for his exceptional versatility and consistency. He was capable of playing anywhere in [[Midfielder|midfield]] or along the [[Forward (association football)|front line]], and was fielded in all positions on the pitch throughout his career, except those of [[central defender]] and [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]]. A strong, courageous, energetic and hard-working team player, with good technical skills, flair and notable stamina, his usual position was as an [[attacking midfielder]] in the centre of the pitch, due to his ability to link-up the forwards and the midfield, or as a [[right winger]], but he was capable of playing anywhere along the right flank, and was often deployed as an attacking [[Full back (association football)|full-back]] or [[wing-back (association football)|wing-back]], or even as a left winger on occasion.

Due to his keen eye for goal and ability to make attacking runs into the box, Enrique frequently played as a forward, either in a withdrawn role as a [[Forward (association football)#Second striker|second striker]] behind the team's main goalscorer, or even as an out-and-out [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] or [[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|centre-forward]] – he was also used in deeper midfield roles. In addition to his playing abilities, he also stood out for his commitment, temperament, determination and leadership.<ref name=Normal/><ref>{{cite news|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1991/08/17/deportes/682380001_850215.html|title=Antic: "Estoy seguro de que mi sistema es bueno"|trans-title=Antic: "I'm sure my system is good"|newspaper=El País|last=Miguelez|first=José|language=es|date=17 August 1991|access-date=4 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1991/09/29/deportes/686095202_850215.html|title=El Madrid desborda a un lastimoso Sevilla|trans-title=Madrid tear pitiful Sevilla apart|newspaper=El País|last=Segurola|first=Santiago|language=es|date=29 September 1991|access-date=4 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://elpais.com/diario/1993/03/14/deportes/732063611_850215.html|title=El Madrid intentará golear al Logroñés en el Bernabéu|trans-title=Madrid will try to rout Logroñés at the Bernabéu|newspaper=El País|language=es|date=14 March 1993|access-date=4 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1997/08/12/pagina-7/379942/pdf.html|title=El jugador más versátil|trans-title=The most versatile player|newspaper=Mundo Deportivo|last=Domènech|first=Oriol|language=es|date=12 August 1997|access-date=24 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1998/09/25/pagina-2/406719/pdf.html|title=Van Gaal, sin dudas|trans-title=Van Gaal, no doubts|newspaper=Mundo Deportivo|last=Serra|first=Josep María|language=es|date=25 September 1998|access-date=24 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://arxiu.fcbarcelona.cat/web/castellano/noticies/futbol/temporada10-11/07/22/n100722112123.html|title=Adriano: el "relevo" de Luis Enrique|trans-title=Adriano: Luis Enrique's "replacement"|publisher=FC Barcelona|language=es|date=22 July 2010|access-date=4 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/luis-enrique-martinez_(Enciclopedia-dello-Sport)/|title=LUIS ENRIQUE Martinez|publisher=Treccani: Enciclopedia dello Sport (2002)|last=Ordine|first=Franco|language=it|access-date=13 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.solocalcio.com/gallery/stelle98/lestelle05.htm|title=Le stelle di Francia 98: da Luis Enrique a Hadij|trans-title=The stars of France 98: from Luis Enrique to Hadij|publisher=Solo Calcio|language=it|access-date=13 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fcbarcelona.com/club/history/card/luis-enrique-martinez|title=Luis Enrique Martínez|publisher=FC Barcelona|access-date=13 January 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.football-espana.net/clubs/Barcelona/squad|title=Coach – Luis Enrique|publisher=Football España|date=19 March 2014|access-date=6 February 2017}}</ref>

===Barcelona===
On 19 May 2014, Enrique returned to Barcelona as a manager on a two-year deal. He was recommended by sporting director [[Andoni Zubizarreta]], his former national teammate.<ref name=Appoint>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/27477125|title=Barcelona appoint Luis Enrique as first-team coach|publisher=BBC Sport|date=19 May 2014|access-date=19 May 2014}}</ref> His first competitive match was a 3–0 home league win over [[Elche CF|Elche]], where he handed debuts to new signings [[Claudio Bravo]], [[Jérémy Mathieu]] and [[Ivan Rakitić]], and gave youth products [[Munir El Haddadi]], [[Rafinha (footballer, born February 1993)|Rafinha]] and [[Sandro Ramírez|Sandro]] their maiden league appearances for the club, while summer signing [[Luis Suárez]] was unavailable for selection due to suspension.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/28920099|title=Barcelona 3–0 Elche|publisher=BBC Sport|last=Cryer|first=Andy|date=24 August 2014|access-date=25 August 2014}}</ref>

Enrique suffered his first defeat in the competition on 25 October 2014, away against Real Madrid, and although Barcelona had a successful run in the year, his management came under scrutiny because of his tactics involving several lineup changes in consecutive games. Moreover, a quarrel with [[Lionel Messi]] and other players further accentuated the team's poor form.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.com/barcelona/story/2270744/lionel-messi-and-luis-enrique-argued-in-barcelona-training-reveals-jeremy-Mathieu|title=Lionel Messi, Luis Enrique argued in Barcelona training, says Mathieu|publisher=ESPN FC|last=Holyman|first=Ian|date=29 January 2015|access-date=28 February 2015}}</ref>

Amid reports of dressing room unrest, in early January, and on back of a defeat to [[Real Sociedad]] Zubizarreta was sacked, weakening Enrique's standing at the club. A significant upturn in form followed, as a result of the coach deciding on a settled lineup with a tweak in the formation: Messi and [[Neymar]] now played as inverted wingers, while Suárez was the lone striker.

In his first two seasons at the Camp Nou, Enrique fielded a [[Formation (association football)|4–3–3 formation]]. Results improved after he stopped tinkering with his starting eleven. The team's creative outlet was the wings with Neymar and Messi as inside forwards flanking Suárez, a departure from their usual playing style. [[Ivan Rakitić]] played a pivotal role in transitioning defense to attack, and [[Andrés Iniesta]]'s influence withered, while [[Xavi]], the club's captain, reduced to a part-time, [[Substitute (association football)|substitute]] role. With overlapping full-backs offering width, Neymar and Messi often drifted in-field, encouraging midfielders, Rakitic and Iniesta, to move into channels and attack in and around the box. In his third and final year, struggling for form and results, the manager switched to a 3–4–3 offense morphing into a 4–4–2 defensive shape, reminiscent of [[Antonio Conte]]'s [[Premier League]] winners [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] more than [[Johan Cryuff]]'s [[Barcelona (Dream Team)|Dream Team]], with Messi at the top of a midfield diamond, acting as chief play-maker, and [[Sergio Busquets]], the sole holding defensive midfielder, responsible for breaking the first-line of opposition press. The system favoured Neymar in particular, who played as a left forward, often cutting inside to link with lone striker Suárez, or to create an overload in the final-third sharing creative responsibilities with Messi. This change in formation was instrumental as they overcame 0–4, the biggest first-leg deficit in Champions League history, by [[La Remontada|defeating PSG 6–1 in the second-leg]]; however, the physical and tactical discipline required to sustain a 3–4–3 proved controversial.{{r|School}}<ref name=CW>{{cite web|url=https://www.coachesvoice.com/luis-enrique-barcelona-spain-guardiola/|title=Luis Enrique: Coach Watch|publisher=Coaches' Voice|date=23 March 2021|access-date=19 June 2021|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210619165032/https://www.coachesvoice.com/luis-enrique-barcelona-spain-guardiola/|archive-date=19 June 2021}}</ref><ref name="wingplay">{{cite web|url=https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2016/12/22/14064182/tactics-key-difference-luis-enrique-barcelona-pep-guardiola|title=Tactics: Key difference between Luis Enrique's Barcelona and Pep Guardiola's team|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|last=Mazariegos|first=Luis|date=22 December 2016|access-date=19 June 2021|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210619165337/https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2016/12/22/14064182/tactics-key-difference-luis-enrique-barcelona-pep-guardiola|archive-date=19 June 2021}}</ref><ref name=FW>{{cite web|url=https://footballwhispers.com/blog/luis-enrique-high-risk-appointment/|title=Why Luis Enrique shouldn't take over at Arsenal|publisher=Football Whispers|date=23 April 2018|access-date=19 June 2021|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210619165516/https://footballwhispers.com/blog/luis-enrique-high-risk-appointment/|archive-date=19 June 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.marca.com/en/football/barcelona/2017/03/21/58d18e08268e3ea9258b457a.html|title=Understanding Barcelona's 3–4–3: Luis Enrique's last hurrah|newspaper=Marca|last=Sainati|first=Aldo|date=21 March 2017|access-date=19 June 2021|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210619165448/https://www.marca.com/en/football/barcelona/2017/03/21/58d18e08268e3ea9258b457a.html|archive-date=19 June 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.in/football/barcelona/story/3069711/barcelona-formation-switch-meant-to-confuse-atletico-madrid-luis-enrique|title=Barcelona formation switch meant to confuse Atletico Madrid – Luis Enrique|publisher=ESPN|last=Marsden|first=Sam|date=26 February 2017|access-date=19 June 2021|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210619180155/https://www.espn.in/football/barcelona/story/3069711/barcelona-formation-switch-meant-to-confuse-atletico-madrid-luis-enrique|archive-date=19 June 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2017/3/2/14754650/luis-enrique-3-4-3-but-did-it-work-for-fc-barcelona-atletico-madrid|title=Luis Enrique took my advice and played 3–4–3.

Enrique continued to favour 4–3–3 for Spain, and at times the riskier 3–4–3 when the situation demands, with the sole defensive midfielder in the pivot being the only commonality. Lacking the front three he had at Barcelona, his football retains positional and vertical aspects, though with box-to-box central midfielders, like [[Koke (footballer, born 1992)|Koke]] or [[Pedri]], offering attacking thrust while the center forward drops deep to bring wide forwards into play, accompanied by overlapping full-backs who offer width. Whilst pressing oppositions high-up, the center forward, usually [[Álvaro Morata]], screens the opposition defensive midfielder as wide forwards engage opposition center backs. Spain's defensive midfielder, often Busquets, tracks the run of opposition attackers when they drop deep, some times pressing higher than the team's other central midfielders. In possession, Spain usually start playing out from the back, to draw the opposition in, with [[Thiago Alcântara]] or any other central midfielder, dropping alongside Busquets to help progress the ball forward. Should the opposition press aggressively, the full-backs link up to offer additional passing options as the center backs go deep and narrow. Wide forwards make diagonal runs into the midfield to link play with those in front of them. Once the ball has been progressed out of the defense, they adjust their attacking rhythm to match opposition's defensive structure, either opting for a speedy transition against a higher block or relying on a more positional approach play against a lower block. To mix it up, Spain initially build up short in the defensive-third to then play long to the center forward who then attempts to bring outfield runners in to play. Wing play is used to stretch opposition and create spaces infield or create crossing opportunities, especially against compact defenses.{{r|CW}}

Known for his brave and fearless management style, Enrique is quick to curb out source of any influence that undermines his authority. Reports of his altercation with Messi at Barcelona and with Totti at Roma, both of whom wield considerable power at their respective clubs, being prime examples of that.{{r|School}} His flexibility in adopting different playing styles, while at odds with the [[Tiki-taka|possession-based style]] synonymous with Barcelona, furthered this narrative, as he continued to remain unfazed in the face of criticism and pressure.{{r|FW}} [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]] president [[Luis Rubiales]], on the back of three consecutive unsuccessful tournaments, appointed him to curb ill-discipline and complacency in the squad, stating: "We are looking for an incontestable leader, who sets out the path, and nobody then strays from that path."{{r|School}}

===Reception===
Messi described Enrique as one of the two best managers he has played for, the other being Guardiola.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.beinsports.com/us/laliga/video/lionel-messi-says-pep-guardiola-and-luis-enri/1608074|title=Lionel Messi says Pep Guardiola and Luis Enrique were his best coaches at Barca|publisher=[[beIN Sports]]|date=26 December 2020|access-date=19 June 2021|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210619150908/https://www.beinsports.com/us/laliga/video/lionel-messi-says-pep-guardiola-and-luis-enri/1608074|archive-date=19 June 2021}}</ref> While Guardiola maintains that though he has played against many great footballing sides as a manager, Enrique's Barcelona and [[Jürgen Klopp]]'s [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] were the best he has ever faced.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2019/5/6/18531558/guardiola-the-best-two-sides-i-ever-faced-were-klopps-liverpool-luis-enriques-barcelona|title=Guardiola: The best two sides I ever faced were Klopp's Liverpool & Luis Enrique's Barcelona|publisher=SB Nation|last=Mazariegos|first=Luis|date=6 May 2019|access-date=19 June 2021|archive-url=https://archive.today/20210619151122/https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2019/5/6/18531558/guardiola-the-best-two-sides-i-ever-faced-were-klopps-liverpool-luis-enriques-barcelona|archive-date=19 June 2021}}</ref>

In comparing the managers he has played for, Spain international Alcântara said, "[Enrique] has the analytical positioning of Pep [and] the aggressiveness of Klopp" while also praising Enrique's communication skills in conveying his footballing ideas.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/18/thiago-alcantara-we-see-less-magic-less-fantasy-footballers-do-more-but-faster|title=Thiago Alcântara: 'We see less magic, less fantasy.
