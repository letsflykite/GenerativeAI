==Club career==
===Early years===
Born in [[Hita, Oita|Hita]], [[Oita Prefecture|Oita]], Mitoma grew up in [[Miyamae-ku, Kawasaki|Miyamae-ku]] in the city of [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]] and joined the Frontale academy at the U10 level. Offered a promotion from the U-18s to the senior team coached by [[Yahiro Kazama]], he instead chose the [[University of Tsukuba]], a Japanese university football powerhouse who had recently produced Frontale stalwarts such as [[Shogo Taniguchi]] and [[Shintaro Kurumaya]]. Mitoma professed to feeling unprepared to enter professional football at age 18, citing the struggles of fellow Kawasaki academy products [[Ko Itakura]] and [[Koji Miyoshi]] to win regular playing time with the senior squad.<ref name="Number Web">{{cite web |last1=Ando |first1=Takahito |title=フロンターレ昇格を蹴って進学。筑波大・三笘薫、人生の選択について。 |url=https://number.bunshun.jp/articles/-/830894 |website=[[Number (magazine)|Sports Graphic Number]] |publisher=[[Bungeishunjū]] |accessdate=20 October 2020 |language=Portuguese |date=28 May 2018}}</ref><ref name="globoesporte">{{cite web |last1=Bontempo |first1=Tiago |title=Mitoma, a sensação da J.League que só virou profissional aos 22 anos para 'garantir seu futuro' na faculdade |url=https://globoesporte.globo.com/blogs/futebol-no-japao/post/2020/09/05/mitoma-a-sensacao-da-jleague-que-so-virou-profissional-aos-22-anos-para-garantir-seu-futuro-na-faculdade.ghtml |website=[[Globo Esporte]] |publisher=[[Grupo Globo]] |accessdate=14 October 2020 |language=Portuguese |date=5 September 2020}}</ref> He wrote his university thesis on dribbling.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.ph/Eh1Qb|title=Kaoru Mitoma: How a degree in dribbling shaped Brighton's breakout star|publisher=thetimes.co.uk (Archived)}}</ref>

During his time at Tsukuba, Mitoma was selected to represent Japan at the [[2017 Summer Universiade|2017]] and [[2019 Summer Universiade|2019]] Universiade tournaments, as well as the [[Football at the 2018 Asian Games|2018 Asian Games]] and the [[2019 Toulon Tournament]] with the [[Japan national under-23 football team|under-23 national team]]. Playing in the [[:ja:関東大学サッカーリーグ戦|Kanto University Soccer League]] with Tsukuba, he was named to the all-league XI in his final three seasons while majoring in [[physical education]]. In addition, Tsukuba appeared in the [[2016 Emperor's Cup|2016]] and [[2017 Emperor's Cup|2017]] [[Emperor's Cup]] tournaments making an upstart run to the round of 16 in the latter edition, upsetting [[J.League]] clubs [[YSCC Yokohama]], [[Vegalta Sendai]] (against whom Mitoma scored a brace), and [[Avispa Fukuoka]] along the way. While enrolled in college, Mitoma also occasionally joined Frontale's senior team for training sessions as a [[J.League designated special players|Special Designated Player]] starting in his sophomore year, appearing in a single [[J.League Cup]] match in 2019.<ref name="globoesporte" />
