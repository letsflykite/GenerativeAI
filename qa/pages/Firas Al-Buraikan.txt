'''Firas Tariq Nasser Al-Buraikan''' ({{lang-ar|فراس طارق ناصر البريكان}}; born 14 May 2000) is a Saudi Arabian professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] for [[Saudi Professional League]] side [[Al Fateh SC|Al-Fateh]] and the [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia national team]].<ref>{{cite web |title=فراس البريكان - |url=http://www.kooora.com/?player=125903 |access-date=3 January 2019}}</ref><ref>https://www.flashscore.com/player/al-birakan-firas/ltjsmFe0/</ref>

==International career==

Al-Buraikan was first summoned for the [[Saudi Arabia national under-20 football team|U-20 national team]] in Saudi Arabia's successful [[2018 AFC U-19 Championship]] conquest, scoring one goal in Saudi Arabia's 3–1 win over [[Australia men's national under-20 soccer team|Australia]]. Although scoring just one, his successful display in the tournament allowed him to be summoned for the Saudi squad in the [[2019 FIFA U-20 World Cup]], where he had a successful performance with two goals against [[Mali national under-20 football team|Mali]] and [[Panama national under-20 football team|Panama]]; however, his successful performance didn't transcend to the team as the under-20 Asian champions crumbled from the group stage with a humiliating three straight defeats. He carried the same successes to the [[Saudi Arabia national under-23 football team|under-23 team]] in the [[2020 AFC U-23 Championship]] and [[2022 AFC U-23 Asian Cup]], as the Saudis reached the final twice, winning the latter for the first time; the good form in 2020 event allowed him to become part of the Saudi Olympic side in the [[Football at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2020 Summer Olympics]], though this time, he failed to score as Saudi Arabia once again crumbled at the group stage with three straight defeats.

Nonetheless, his good form at the under-20 allowed him to be summoned for the senior side in 2019 for the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC second round]] against Singapore. He scored his first international goal against [[Kuwait national football team|Kuwait]] in the [[24th Arabian Gulf Cup]] as Saudi Arabia lost 3–1. He went on to play an instrumental role, scoring three goals in the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC third round|third round]] as Saudi Arabia impressed by topping the qualifiers. He then took part in the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] of the squad, and greatly impressed with an assist in Saudi Arabia's historic 2–1 win over [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in what would be the greatest upset in World Cup history. However, the assist turned to be Al-Buraikan's only impression, as his inability to score saw Saudi Arabia condemned to bottom place after losing to [[Poland national football team|Poland]] and [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]].
