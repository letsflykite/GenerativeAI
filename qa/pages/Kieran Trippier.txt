'''Kieran John Trippier''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|r|ɪ|p|j|ər}};<ref>{{cite AV media |via=Twitter |title=#THFC team |time=6 seconds |date=30 January 2016 |author=Kieran Trippier |publisher=Tottenham Hotspur F.C. |url=https://twitter.com/SpursOfficial/status/693399523561906176 |access-date=12 July 2021}}</ref> born 19 September 1990) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[right-back]] for {{English football updater|NewcastU}} club [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and the [[England national football team|England national team]].

Trippier started his career in the youth system at [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] but failed to make the breakthrough to the first team, having two [[Loan (association football)|loans]] at [[EFL Championship|Championship]] club [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]]. In 2011, he signed for Championship club [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]] on a season-long loan which was made permanent in January 2012 for an undisclosed fee. He was named in the Championship [[PFA Team of the Year]] for two consecutive seasons in 2012–13 and 2013–14. In 2014, he secured promotion with Burnley to the Premier League as the team finished runners-up in the Championship. A year later, he signed for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] for a £3.5&nbsp;million fee. After four years in North London, during which he became part of the squad that finished as runners-up in the [[2019 UEFA Champions League Final|2019 Champions League final]], Trippier joined Spanish side [[Atlético Madrid]], where he helped the team win the [[2020–21 La Liga]] title. 

Trippier also represented England at all levels from under-18 to under-21, featuring in the [[2009 UEFA European Under-19 Championship]] and [[2009 FIFA U-20 World Cup]]. He made his senior international debut in June 2017 and was part of the team that reached the semi-finals of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].
