====2016–17 season====
Coman made only 25 appearances in all competitions during the season. Coman had problems with injuries and couldn't force himself into the starting line-up like he did last season.

During the season, Coman played a lesser role than under last season's manager, [[Pep Guardiola]]. At the end of the season, Coman said in an interview with [[France Football]], "I was perhaps in a position that suited me a bit better [under Guardiola]. I had fewer injuries too. I played more on the wing, and the coach asked me to take people on. That's what I do best, it's the essence of my game.
