==Style of play==
Regarded as a talented and highly promising young attacking winger in the media, Torres has been described as a traditional wide midfielder, due to his work-rate and penchant for running to the touchline, although he is also capable of cutting inside towards the centre of the pitch; due to his role, nationality, and playing style, Simone Lorini has likened him to [[Joaquín (footballer, born 1981)|Joaquín]]. Torres is known in particular for his pace, creativity, technique, and his close control at speed, which enables him to take on opponents and overload the flanks, while his height, athleticism, and heading ability also make him a strong aerial presence. Although he primarily plays on the right, he is capable of playing anywhere across the attacking line. In 2018, Spanish football journalist [[Guillem Balagué]] noted that Torres "is a [[Dribbling (association football)|dribbler]], fast on the wing, can play on either wing, and he has got ability and intelligence. He can also play inside if needed, so he is a modern winger." The Valencia academy director of recruitment, José Giménez, instead stated: "He's powerful, quick, steady with the ball at his feet and strong in the air. He's unpredictable. When he's running with the ball at his feet he can go on inside or outside his man because he is two-footed. He can [[Cross (football)|cross]], finish and shoot the football."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Serie-A/Juventus/06-03-2020/fast-food-cani-pipistrelli-chi-ferran-torres-stellina-che-incanta-juve-3601497850921.shtml |title=Fast food, cani e pipistrelli: chi è Ferran Torres, la stellina che piace alla Juve |trans-title=Fast food, dogs and bats: who is Ferran Torres, the little star that Juve likes |newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport |language=it |last1=Seu |first1=Adriano |date=6 March 2020 |access-date=6 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goal.com/story/nxgn2019it/index.html |title=NxGn 2019 |website=Goal |publisher=Perform Group |language=it |access-date=6 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.tuttomercatoweb.com/il-talento-del-giorno/un-talento-al-giorno-ferran-torres-l-ennesima-ala-di-origine-iberica-1101147 |title=Un talento al giorno, Ferran Torres: l'ennesima ala di origine iberica |trans-title=A talent a day, Ferran Torres: the umpteenth winger of Iberian heritage |website=TUTTOmercatoWEB.com |language=it |last1=Lorini |first1=Simone |date=18 April 2018 |access-date=6 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/media-watch/296323-klopp-eyeing-valencia-ace |title=Klopp eyeing Valencia ace |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |date=3 April 2018 |access-date=6 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/news/0251-0e99a363fe06-91ebeb478dad-1000--scout-report-valencia-winger-ferran-torres/ |title=Scout report: Valencia winger Ferrán Torres |publisher=UEFA |date=1 May 2019 |access-date=6 March 2020}}</ref>
