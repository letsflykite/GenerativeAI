The African section of the '''[[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification]]''' acted as qualifiers for the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], to be held in Qatar, for national teams which are members of the [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF). A total of five slots in the final tournament were available for CAF teams.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2015/m=5/news=current-allocation-of-fifa-world-cuptm-confederation-slots-maintained-2610611.html|title=Current allocation of FIFA World Cup confederation slots maintained|publisher=FIFA|date=30 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530211217/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2015/m=5/news=current-allocation-of-fifa-world-cuptm-confederation-slots-maintained-2610611.html|archivedate=30 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

==Format==
A previous proposal to merge the [[2021 Africa Cup of Nations qualification|qualification rounds]] for the [[2021 Africa Cup of Nations]] with those for the World Cup was turned down after a CAF meeting on 11 June 2018.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://futaa.com/article/156514/caf-turns-down-idea-to-pair-world-cup-2022-afcon-2021-qualifiers|title=CAF turns down idea to pair World Cup 2022, AFCON 2021 qualifiers|publisher=Futaa|date=12 June 2018}}</ref>

==Entrants==
All 54 FIFA-affiliated football associations from CAF entered qualification. The FIFA World Rankings of July 2019 were used to determine which nations would compete in the first round. For seeding in the second and third round draws, the most recent FIFA Rankings prior to those draws were used.
