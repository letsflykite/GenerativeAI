'''Gareth Southgate''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|OBE}} (born 3 September 1970) is an English professional [[Association football|football]] manager and former player who played as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] and [[midfielder]]. He has been [[England national football team manager|the manager]] of the [[England national football team|England national team]] since 2016.

Southgate won the [[EFL Cup|League Cup]] with both [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] (in [[1995–96 Football League Cup|1995–96]]) and [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] (in [[2003–04 Football League Cup|2003–04]]) and captained [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] to win the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] championship in [[1993–94 Football League|1993–94]]. He also played in the [[2000 FA Cup Final]] for Villa and the [[2006 UEFA Cup Final]] for Middlesbrough. Internationally, Southgate made 57 appearances for the England team between 1995 and 2004. He played every game of England's campaign in the [[UEFA Euro 1996]], but his penalty miss sent England out in the semi-final. He also featured in both the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] and the [[UEFA Euro 2000]]. His playing career ended in May 2006 at the age of 35, after more than 500 league appearances.

Southgate was manager of Middlesbrough from June 2006 until October 2009. He also managed the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 team]] from 2013 to 2016, before becoming the England national team manager in 2016, succeeding [[Sam Allardyce]]. In his first tournament as England manager, the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], Southgate became the third manager (after [[Alf Ramsey]] and [[Bobby Robson]]) to reach a World Cup semi-final with the England team, which won him the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year Coach Award]]. At [[UEFA Euro 2020]], he became the first England manager to reach the final of a [[UEFA European Championship|European Championship]] and to reach any major tournament final since 1966; England eventually lost to [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in a penalty shootout.

====2008–09 season: Relegation and dismissal====
The pre-season build-up ahead of the [[2008–09 Middlesbrough F.C. season|2008–09 season]] was disappointing for the club. Due to heavy spending during the previous season, the club's net spending was almost nil. Furthermore, club legend [[Mark Schwarzer]] left the club after eleven years, joining Premier League rivals [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] on the expiration of his contract.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.mfc.premiumtv.co.uk/page/News/NewsDetail/0,,1~1317422,00.html |title=Mark's Departure Opens The Door |publisher=Middlesbrough F.C. |date=22 May 2008 |access-date=22 May 2008}}{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Furthermore, key players such as [[George Boateng]] and [[Lee Cattermole]] also left the club, once again leaving Southgate with a rebuilding challenge to change Middlesbrough's fortunes.<ref name="BoatengOut">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/h/hull_city/7506630.stm |title=Hull sign three players in a day |website=BBC Sport |date=16 July 2008 |access-date=16 July 2008}}</ref><ref name="CattermoleOut">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wigan_athletic/7521234.stm |title=Cattermole wraps up move to Wigan |website=BBC Sport |date=29 July 2008 |access-date=29 July 2008| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080724212539/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wigan_athletic/7521234.stm| archive-date= 24 July 2008 | url-status= live}}</ref> Despite the negative events during pre-season, Middlesbrough secured two victories out of a possible three, resulting in Southgate being named the [[Premier League Manager of the Month]] for August.

In November 2008, Southgate took Middlesbrough up to eighth place in the league, following an away win against an in-form [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]], another former playing club of Southgate's; however, Middlesbrough then went fourteen games without a win, until they beat Liverpool at home 2–0 on 28 February 2009.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.statto.com/football/teams/middlesbrough/2008-2009/results |title=Middlesbrough 2008–2009: Results |publisher=Statto Organisation |access-date=23 September 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131001104330/http://www.statto.com/football/teams/middlesbrough/2008-2009/results |archive-date=1 October 2013 |url-status=dead}}</ref> After an away defeat against [[Stoke City]], some of the travelling supporters were calling for his dismissal, having only achieved a single win in eighteen games and survival from relegation looking highly unlikely.

Due to results elsewhere, Middlesbrough's status as a Premier League club went down to the final day: they needed relegation rivals [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] and [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]] to lose, with them needing a five-goal swing to the latter in goal difference.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/match_preview/0,19764,11065_3005637,00.html |title=West Ham v Boro preview |website=Sky Sports |date=22 May 2009 |access-date=7 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525082037/http://www.skysports.com/football/match_preview/0%2C19764%2C11065_3005637%2C00.html |archive-date=25 May 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref> Middlesbrough faced [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] away from home; the game ended in a 2–1 defeat, confirming Middlesbrough's relegation to the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] after eleven consecutive seasons in the top-flight, as a 19th-place finish was confirmed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/8048322.stm |title=West Ham 2–1 Middlesbrough |date=24 May 2009 |website=BBC Sport |access-date=26 May 2009 |first=Mark |last=Ashenden}}</ref> Following their relegation, Southgate expressed his determination to achieve instant promotion back up to the Premier League, praising the supporters and showing his sorrow for them in the process.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.setanta.com/uk/Articles/Football/2009/05/24/Prem-Southgate-on-Setanta/gnid-54374 |title=Southgate plans to stay |author=Pope, Gordon |publisher=Setanta Sports |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527053001/http://www.setanta.com/uk/Articles/Football/2009/05/24/Prem-Southgate-on-Setanta/gnid-54374/ |archive-date=27 May 2009}}</ref>

Middlesbrough's Championship campaign started strongly, putting them in contention for an immediate return to the Premier League. However, on 20 October 2009, shortly after a 2–0 victory over [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and with the club in fourth place, Southgate was dismissed as manager.

Southgate would go on to lead his team to qualify for the finals of the [[2015 UEFA European Under-21 Championship|2015 European Championship]]; their good fortune could not continue however, as they finished bottom of their narrow-pointed group, therefore being knocked out of the competition.
