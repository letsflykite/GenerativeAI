==Club career==
===Real Sociedad===
====Early career====
When he first arrived at Real Sociedad, Griezmann lodged with the club's French scout while attending school across the border in [[Bayonne]], training in the evenings at the [[Zubieta Facilities|club's headquarters]] in San Sebastián.<ref name ="griezmann_career"/> It took him time to break into Real Sociedad's first team, but after four years in the [[Real Sociedad Juvenil|club's youth system]] he made his debut, called up by [[Martín Lasarte]] for Real Sociedad's [[2009–10 Segunda División|2009–10]] pre-season campaign. In the pre-season, he scored five goals in four appearances and an injury to the team's regular left-winger led to Lasarte selecting him for the start of the season (unusually for a youth graduate, bypassing [[Real Sociedad B|the reserve team]] altogether).<ref name ="griezmann_career"/>
