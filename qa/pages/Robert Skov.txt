==Player profile==
Skov is two footed, although his left foot is his main scoring weapon. He is a skilled winger who is renowned for taking on defenders and dribbling past them. He is also well known for scoring many goals and creating numerous assists. He is especially making a name for himself as a free kick specialist, by blasting in goals on a regular basis. So much so that Danish international player Christian Eriksen suggested that Skov would overtake him as being the number one free kick taker for the Danish national team.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Chatterjee |first1=Saikat |title=Christian Eriksen heaps praise on Spurs target Robert Skov |url=https://sportslens.com/news/christian-eriksen-heaps-praise-on-spurs-target-robert-skov/ |access-date=22 November 2022 |work=Sportslens |date=24 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211127064213/https://sportslens.com/news/christian-eriksen-heaps-praise-on-spurs-target-robert-skov/ |archive-date=27 November 2021}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Skov's parents moved from Denmark to Spain in 1994 when his father took a job with a bank in [[Gibraltar]], and as a result, Skov was born in [[Marbella]]. His family returned to Denmark when he was nine months old.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Hoffenheim|first=TSG 1899|title=Skov: a late bloomer on a voyage of discovery|url=https://www.tsg-hoffenheim.de/en/news/overview/2020/01/skov-a-late-bloomer-on-a-voyage-of-discovery/|access-date=26 May 2021|website=www.tsg-hoffenheim.de|language=en-US}}</ref>
