Kane's former youth coach [[Alex Inglethorpe]] has said of him:<blockquote>When he first came into the under-18s as a 15 year old, he stood out in the sense he looked a bit gangly. He moved slightly awkwardly, he was a bit cumbersome. But look closer, he had a lot of ability, a great technique. I think he surprised people how good he was. Tactically he was very flexible. He often played in midfield. I remember seeing him once playing as a [[Midfielder#Holding midfielder|holding midfielder]].<ref name=jim/></blockquote>

While a teenager, Kane initially struggled in Tottenham's academy, as partially due to his date of birth in July, he was not as physically developed as other players, nor was he as quick.

{{Quote box|width=25%|align=left|quoted=1|quote=“He seems to have that natural ability to get goals. He's also young, fresh and his attitude appears to be very, very good.
