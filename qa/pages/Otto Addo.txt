He was recently the manager of the [[Ghana national football team]], and works as a talent coach for [[Borussia Dortmund]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/otto-addo-fortsaetter-i-gladbach/ | title = Otto Addo fortsætter i Gladbach | language = da | website = bold.dk | date = 2 June 2017 | access-date = 2 June 2017}}</ref>

== Early life ==
Addo was born on 9 June 1975 in [[Hamburg]], [[West Germany]] to Ghanaian parents.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Otto Addo|url=https://gh.soccerway.com/coaches/otto-addo/270941/ |access-date=15 May 2021|website=Soccerway}}</ref>

==Club career==
===VfL 93 Hamburg===
Addo started his career in 1991 in Hamburg playing for Hamburger SV. In 1993 he left [[Bramfelder SV]] after playing there for a year to join fellow Hamburg side [[VfL 93 Hamburg]] in 1993 where he played 80 league matches and scored 4 goals from 1993 to 1996.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|title=Otto Addo|url=https://www.kicker.de/otto-addo/laufbahn/2-bundesliga/1998-99/hannover-96 |access-date=14 May 2021|website=Kicker.de}}</ref>

=== Hannover 96 ===
Addo moved to [[Hannover 96]] in the ''Regionalliga Nord'' (third German league) in 1996.<ref name=":2" /> He made a big impression in a squad that featured stars-to-be [[Gerald Asamoah]] and [[Fabian Ernst]]. That team ripped through the season scoring more than 100 goals but succumbed to [[Energie Cottbus]] in the 1997 promotion playoffs.

In 1998, Hannover finally promoted to the [[2. Bundesliga]]. In his first season, he scored seven goals in 30 games and was acknowledged as one of the elite players of the league.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Einst "junge Wilde" bei 96, heute Vaterfiguren: Warum im Pokalfinale ein wenig Hannover steckte|url=https://www.sportbuzzer.de/artikel/dfb-pokal-finale-rb-leipzig-bvb-otto-addo-babacar-ndiaye-hannover-96/|access-date=14 May 2021|website=Sportbuzzer.de|language=de}}</ref>

=== Borussia Dortmund ===
Addo transferred to [[Borussia Dortmund]] in 1999 and played more than 75 times for the team, becoming [[Bundesliga]] champion in [[2001–02 Bundesliga|2002]]. However, he was also hampered by great injury troubles, as he tore his [[cruciate ligament]]s three times in this time, the first coming after a [[DFB-Pokal|German Cup]] match against [[SC Freiburg]] on 15 July 2001. The player had an MRI scan which showed he had torn knee ligaments and underwent surgery on his right knee on 22 July at the [[Vail]], [[Colorado]] clinic of world-renowned knee specialist surgeon [[Richard Steadman|Dr. Richard Steadman]].<ref>{{cite news | date= 16 July 2001 | url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/SportsArchive/artikel.php?ID=16659 | title=Injury KO for Otto Addo | publisher=Ghanaweb | access-date= 16 July 2001}}</ref> He healed completely after that, and came back to play the [[2002 UEFA Cup Final]] for Dortmund against [[Feyenoord Rotterdam]] on 8 May 2002, which Dortmund lost 3–2<ref>{{cite news | date=8 May 2002 | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/uefa_cup/1973191.stm | title=Feyenoord seal Uefa Cup win | publisher=BBC | access-date= 8 May 2002}}</ref> at the [[Feijenoord Stadion]] in [[Rotterdam]]. On 7 September 2002, Addo tore right knee ligaments for the second time, in a [[2004 African Cup of Nations]] qualifier versus [[Uganda national football team|Uganda]]<ref>{{cite web | title = Uganda Shock Ghana | url = http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/SportsArchive/artikel.php?ID=27164 | publisher = Ghanaweb | access-date = 7 February 2008}}</ref> in [[Kampala]].<ref>{{cite news | date= 9 September 2002 | url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/SportsArchive/artikel.php?ID=27202 | title=Otto Addo out for rest of year | publisher=Ghanaweb | access-date=9 September 2002}}</ref>

On 24 September 2003, Addo's career was under threat after he re-injured his troublesome right knee for the third time in Dortmund's 2–1 [[UEFA Cup]] victory over [[FK Austria Wien|Austria Wien]].<ref>{{cite news | date=30 September 2003 | url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/SportsArchive/artikel.php?ID=43887 | title=Otto Addo's Injury Not Career Threatening | publisher=Ghanaweb | access-date= 30 September 2003}}</ref> He started the match, but was replaced after just 38 minutes.<ref>{{cite news | date= 25 September 2003 | url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/SportsArchive/artikel.php?ID=43592 | title=Addo's career under threat after injury | publisher=Ghanaweb | access-date= 25 September 2003}}</ref>

After sitting out the whole of 2004, Addo returned to action as a substitute in Dortmund's 1–1 league home draw with [[Borussia Mönchengladbach]] in the last weekend of January 2005.

=== Mainz 05 ===
At the beginning of the 2005–06 season he transferred<ref>{{cite news|date=10 February 2006 |url=http://www.hsv.de/index.php?id=14989 |title=Otto Addo: Hamburg born and bred! |publisher=HSV |access-date=10 February 2006 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928040823/http://www.hsv.de/index.php?id=14989 |archive-date=28 September 2007 }}</ref> to [[1. FSV Mainz 05]], for whom he did not make an initial impact. However, he played well enough to earn a nomination for the Ghanaian squad who appeared at the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]].

=== Hamburger SV ===
On 9 August 2007, Addo signed a three-year contract with hometown [[Hamburger SV]],<ref>{{cite news |date=9 August 2007 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/6938949.stm |title=Hamburg in shock Addo swoop |publisher=BBC |access-date=9 August 2007}}</ref> initially alternating with the reserves and the first team.
