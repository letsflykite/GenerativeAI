== Early life ==
Born in the [[Ashanti Region]] of Ghana, Afriyie is an [[Akan people|Akan]] by birth and descent.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=3 February 2020|title=All you need to know about Hearts of Oak golden boy Daniel Afriyie|url=https://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/SportsArchive/All-you-need-to-know-about-Hearts-of-Oak-golden-boy-Daniel-Afriyie-855499|access-date=20 August 2021|website=GhanaWeb|language=en}}</ref> He attended Dunyan Nkwanta JHS in the [[Ahafo Ano South District|Ahafo Ano South district]], [[Mankranso]] in Ashanti Region and later proceeded to Aduman Senior High School in [[Aduman]] for his secondary school education. He admired Brazilian striker [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] and idolizes [[Sergio Agüero]] who he considers as his idol.<ref name=":0" />

== Club career ==

=== Early career ===
Afriyie featured for a number of [[Youth system|colts]] (juvenile) clubs in the Ashanti Region where he ascended to a cult hero status. He began at [[Amansie West District|Amansie]] FC before joining Celtic Academy in Kumasi then moved to colts club Valencia in 2015.<ref name=":0" />

He moved a step further in his career by moving to the [[Division Two League, Ghana|Ghana Division Two League]] with Galaxy United where he featured from 2016 to 2017.<ref name=":0" /> In January 2018, Afriyie joined [[Burkina Faso]] top flight side [[Rahimo FC]] where helped the club to win the [[Burkinabé Premier League]] in the [[2018–19 Burkinabé Premier League]] season and secure qualification to the [[2019–20 CAF Champions League]].<ref name=":0" /> He made a return to Ghana and joined Thunder Bolt also in the Ghana Division Two League and played for a short stint before securing a move to Madina Republicans in the same league in 2019.<ref>{{Cite web|date=27 July 2021|title=Hearts darling boy Afriyie Barnieh visits former club Madina Republicans|url=https://ghanasoccernet.com/hearts-darling-boy-afriyie-barnieh-visits-former-club-madina-republicans|access-date=20 August 2021|website=GhanaSoccernet|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> In December 2019, Afriyie was given a four-week trial at [[Asante Kotoko S.C.|Kumasi Asante Kotoko]]. He failed to impress during the trials after being played out of position as an out and out striker but found it difficult to communicate it to the coach with fear of being dropped.<ref name=":3">{{Cite web|last=Tahiru|first=Fentuo|date=28 June 2021|title=Afriyie Barnieh: Once rejected by Kotoko; he's the hero Hearts of Oak deserve|url=https://citisportsonline.com/2021/06/27/afriyie-barnieh-once-rejected-by-kotoko-hes-the-hero-hearts-of-oak-deserve/|url-status=live|access-date=21 August 2021|website=Citi Sports Online|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210627223947/https://citisportsonline.com/2021/06/27/afriyie-barnieh-once-rejected-by-kotoko-hes-the-hero-hearts-of-oak-deserve/ |archive-date=27 June 2021 }}</ref>

=== Hearts of Oak ===
The following month after being dropped by Kotoko, Afriyie was given another chance to play for a [[Ghana Premier League]] side after he was offered as part of negotiations between Hearts of Oak and [[Abdul-Aziz Nurudeen|Abdul Aziz Nurudeen]] who he shared the same agent with.<ref name=":3" /> He was given the opportunity to trial and be observed by the head coach. Fortunately for him, he impressed the technical staff and on 15 January 2020 he was signed on a three-year deal ahead of the [[2019–20 Ghana Premier League]].<ref>{{Cite web|last=Kapoor|first=Daraja Jr.|date=15 January 2020|title=Hearts of Oak sign highly-rated striker Daniel Barnieh Afriyie|url=https://footballmadeinghana.com/2020/01/15/hearts-of-oak-sign-highly-rated-striker-daniel-barnieh-afriyie/|access-date=20 August 2021|website=Football Made In Ghana|language=en-US}}</ref><ref name=":3" /><ref>{{Cite news|last=Kwafo|first=Eric Nana Yaw|date=15 January 2020|title=OFFICIAL: Hearts Of Oak Announce Capture Of Striker Daniel Barnieh|url=https://www.modernghana.com/sports/979248/official-hearts-of-oak-announce-capture-of-strike.html|url-status=live|access-date=21 August 2021|website=Modern Ghana|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210306043917/https://www.modernghana.com/sports/979248/official-hearts-of-oak-announce-capture-of-strike.html |archive-date=6 March 2021 }}</ref> He made his debut on 19 January 2020 in a 2–1 away win against [[Liberty Professionals F.C.|Liberty Professionals]].<ref name="auto">{{Cite web|title=Match Report of Liberty Professionals FC vs Accra Hearts of Oak SC - 2020-01-19 - Ghana Premier League - Global Sports Archive|url=https://globalsportsarchive.com/match/soccer/2020-01-19/liberty-professionals-fc-vs-accra-hearts-of-oak-sc/1802480/|access-date=17 February 2021|website=globalsportsarchive.com}}</ref>
