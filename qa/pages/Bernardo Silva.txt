==Style of play==
Silva is a diminutive, elegant, and creative left-footed [[playmaker]], with a slender build, who is capable of playing in several attacking and midfield positions. Throughout his career, he has been fielded in a variety of roles, including as a [[Winger (association football)|winger]] on either flank (although he favours the right side of the pitch), as a [[central midfielder]], as a [[deep-lying playmaker]], as an [[attacking midfielder]], or even as a [[second striker]]; he has also been deployed in a [[false 9]] role, or even as [[Wing-back (association football)|wing-back]] on occasion. He is mainly known for his technique, acceleration, agility, passing, ball control, vision, creativity, and [[Dribbling (association football)|dribbling]] skills, as well as his energy and defensive work-rate, which enables him to cover ground, press opponents, and start attacks after winning back possession. Although he is known for his ability to carry the ball forward, run at defences, and retain possession, he is also known to be an intelligent team player, with a strong personality, who prefers to participate in the build-up of offensive plays rather than undertaking individual dribbling runs. Despite primarily being a creative midfielder, he is also capable of scoring goals himself.<ref name="2019 Ballon d'Or Rankings">{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2839568-2019-ballon-dor-rankings-after-champions-league-and-nations-league-finals |title=2019 Ballon d'Or Rankings After Champions League and Nations League Finals |publisher=Bleacher Report |last1=Tighe |first1=Sam |date=10 June 2019 |access-date=6 October 2019 |archive-date=6 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191006010229/https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2839568-2019-ballon-dor-rankings-after-champions-league-and-nations-league-finals |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/talent-scout/2015/02/04-535267/bernardo_silva_il_monaco_lo_riscatta_per_16_milioni/ |title=Bernardo Silva, il Monaco lo riscatta per 16 milioni |trans-title=Bernardo Silva, Monaco acquires him outright for 16 million |work=Il Corriere dello Sport |language=it |last1=Chioffi |first1=Stefano |date=4 February 2015 |access-date=6 October 2019 |archive-date=6 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191006030737/https://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/talent-scout/2015/02/04-535267/bernardo_silva_il_monaco_lo_riscatta_per_16_milioni/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/manchester-city-bernardo-silva-interview-ready-to-make-name-manchester-city-a7937211.html |title=Calm and collected: Bernardo Silva ready to make his name in the Premier League with Manchester City |work=The Independent |last1=Jack |first1=Pitt-Brooke |date=8 September 2017 |access-date=6 October 2019 |archive-date=3 April 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190403204753/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/manchester-city-bernardo-silva-interview-ready-to-make-name-manchester-city-a7937211.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/23/bernardo-silva-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-carabao-cup-final |title=Bernardo Silva: Manchester City's rising star beloved by Pep Guardiola |work=The Guardian |last1=Jackson |first1=Jamie |date=23 February 2019 |access-date=6 October 2019 |archive-date=6 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191006030736/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/feb/23/bernardo-silva-pep-guardiola-manchester-city-carabao-cup-final |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/bernardo-silva-why-spurs-conqueror-142851038.html |title=Bernardo Silva: Why Spurs conqueror could still end up at Manchester United |publisher=Yahoo |last1=Flanagan |first1=Chris |date=15 September 2016 |access-date=6 October 2019 |archive-date=6 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191006030733/https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/bernardo-silva-why-spurs-conqueror-142851038.html |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/bernardo-silva-i-have-always-been-full-of-energy-i-need-to-be-moving-222bm80l5 |title=Bernardo Silva: I have always been full of energy.
