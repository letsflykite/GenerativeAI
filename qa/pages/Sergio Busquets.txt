He is considered to be a [[deep-lying playmaker]] capable of directing gameplay through short and calm passes, exceptional positioning, and his singular reading of the game. These attributes make him exceptionally press-resistant. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest defensive midfielders of all time.<ref name="busquets ranked_1">{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/10054186/barcelona-midfielder-sergio-busquets-is-among-best-in-the-world-says-terry-gibson|title=Barcelona midfielder Sergio Busquets is among best in the world, says Terry Gibson|date=11 November 2015|publisher=Sky Sports|access-date=8 November 2019}}</ref><ref name="busquets ranked_2">{{cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/en-kw/news/casemiro-spains-busquets-is-worlds-best-in-my-position/w49b9j2eulgt1gft8kf6k3tx8|title=Casemiro: Spain's Busquets is world's best in my position|date=29 June 2018|website=Goal.com|access-date=8 November 2019}}</ref><ref name="Roden">{{Cite web |author1=Lee Roden |date=5 February 2016 |title=Is it time to acknowledge Sergio Busquets as the best midfielder in the world? |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/it-time-acknowledge-sergio-busquets-best-midfielder-world |access-date=15 June 2022 |website=fourfourtwo.com |language=en}}</ref>

He arrived in Barcelona's first team in July 2008. Since then he has made over 700 total appearances for the club and has won 32 trophies, including 9 [[La Liga]] titles, 7 [[Copa del Rey]] titles and 3 [[UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions Leagues]]. He was part of the squads that won a continental [[Treble (association football)|treble]] of La Liga, Copa del Rey and the UEFA Champions League in [[2008–09 FC Barcelona season|2008–09]] and [[2014–15 FC Barcelona season|2014–15]]. He left the club after 14 years at the end of the [[2022–23 FC Barcelona season|2022–23 season]], and joined [[Inter Miami CF|Inter Miami]] during the MLS July transfer window in the [[2023 Inter Miami CF season|2023 season]].

Busquets made his senior international debut for Spain in April 2009, and has since made 143 appearances for the national side, scoring twice. He helped the country win the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2012|Euro 2012]] tournaments, and also featured at three other [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]] and two [[UEFA European Championship|European Championships]].

Busquets has been accused of [[Diving (association football)|play-acting]] in the past, due to his tendency of exaggerating fouls. However, in response to these criticisms, he defended his behavior as ''intelligent'', arguing that the realities of the game are more complex.<ref name="A closer look at Spain's Euro 2012 squad"/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.marca.com/2013/10/09/futbol/seleccion/1381319868.html|title=Busquets: "¿Teatreros?
