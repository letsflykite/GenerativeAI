'''Daniel Wass''' (born 31 May 1989) is a Danish professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Danish Superliga]] club [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]] and the [[Denmark national football team|Denmark national team]]. He is capable of playing as a [[midfielder]] and [[Full back (association football)|full-back]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.whoscored.com/Players/27254/Show/Daniel-Wass|title=Daniel Wass Football Statistics|website=Whoscored.com|access-date=12 May 2023}}</ref>

==Early years==
During the majority of his childhood, Wass played for Copenhagen-suburb club [[BK Avarta]], but in 2006, he was scouted by [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]] and promptly switched clubs. After a year of playing for youth teams within the club, he joined the first team.

==Club career==
===Brøndby===
[[File:Wass, Daniel BIF 10-11 WP.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Wass with [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]] in 2010]]
Wass made his debut for  [[Danish Superliga]] team [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]] in the 2007–08 season under manager [[Tom Køhlert]]. He played half of the matches that season but had to withdraw later on due to injury.

Following his recovery from injury Wass secured his place as right defender in the 2008–09 season playing in 28 games from a possible 33, helping Brøndby to reach third place in the Superliga, Brøndby's best position since their second place in the 2005–06 season.

Brøndby manager [[Kent Nielsen]] felt Wass should spend gain further developing at another club, so [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]] chose to loan him out to [[Fredrikstad FK|Fredrikstad]], a medal-competing side from Norway. On 21 August 2009, Wass made his debut in a 4–1 loss against [[Rosenborg BK|Rosenborg]] and on 1 November 2009, Wass started and played the full 90 minutes scoring in a 5–0 win over [[Lyn Fotball|Lyn]]. When the board of Fredrikstad FK signed a new manager, new coach [[Tom Nordlie]] informed Wass that he had no interest in an offensive right defender. As a result of that, Wass received no more than three games before returning to Brøndby in December 2009. For the remainder of the 2009–10 season, Wass played more games for Brøndby, securing his place in the starting eleven.

The season of 2010–11 proved to show Wass' importance for the Brøndby squad when he was selected as first-choice right back for the first 19 games. In February, during the three-month winter break in the Superliga between December and March, Wass announced he would not be renewing his contract with Brøndby. From the beginning of January there had been rumours of Wass' summer transfer to [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Daniel Wass to Benfica|url=http://www.sporten.dk/superligaen/wass-skifter-til-benfica|language=da|access-date=7 June 2011}}</ref> Wass did not comment on the rumours. In March 2011, with 14 matches of the season remaining, the attacking force of Wass was recognised, with Coach [[Henrik Jensen (footballer born 1959)|Henrik Jensen]] subsequently pushing the player up to right midfielder/winger. In his final matches for the club, Wass scored three goals, helping [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]] to gain their third successive third place.

===Transfer to Benfica and loan to Évian===
On 20 May 2011, Wass announced that he had signed a five-year contract with [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Daniel Wass assume Benfica|url=http://www.zerozero.pt/noticia.php?id=28404|language=pt|access-date=7 June 2011}}</ref> However, on 22 July 2011, he was loaned out to [[Evian Thonon Gaillard F.C.]] without taking part in any official games for [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Evian anuncia empréstimo de Wass|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/Nacional/1a_liga/Benfica/interior.aspx?content_id=708702|language=pt|access-date=22 July 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121018220035/http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/Nacional/1a_liga/Benfica/interior.aspx?content_id=708702#|archive-date=18 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> Upon moving to Evian, Wass joined Danish countrymen [[Stephan Andersen]], [[Christian Poulsen]] and [[Thomas Kahlenberg]]. In the four months after joining Evian, Wass was kept out of the first team under [[Bernard Casoni]], who preferred [[Brice Dja Djédjé]], while Wass stated his intention to return to his parent club.<ref>{{cite news|title=Wass: "My goal is to return to Benfica»|trans-title=Wass: "O meu objetivo é regressar ao Benfica"|url=http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/Nacional/1a_liga/Benfica/interior.aspx?content_id=720925|publisher=Jornal Record|language=pt|date=10 October 2011|access-date=13 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130103152811/http://www.record.xl.pt/Futebol/Nacional/1a_liga/Benfica/interior.aspx?content_id=720925#|archive-date=3 January 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> On 15 October 2011, he made his debut, playing in right midfield, making an impact when he provided assist for [[Yannick Sagbo]] in a 2–1 loss against [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]]. Several weeks later, Wass scored in two consecutive games against [[FC Lorient|Lorient]] and [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]]. He scored his third goal of the season in a 2–1 loss against [[Toulouse FC|Toulouse]]. Under new manager [[Pablo Correa]], who succeeded Casoni, Wass secured a place in the first team, mostly being used as left-back, with [[Sidney Govou]] taking his former position in right midfield. After months of being kept out of the first team, he returned again, playing in left-back, due to [[Fabrice Ehret]]. Wass kept his place in the first team towards the end of the season when [[Guillaume Lacour]] took his position as left back, this time returning to the right midfield position. Two games before the end of the season, Wass scored his fourth goal in a 2–1 win over [[AC Ajaccio|Ajaccio]].

===Transfer to Évian===
On 20 June 2012, Wass signed with [[Thonon Évian F.C.|Evian]] on a permanent basis for a €2.5&nbsp;million transfer fee.<ref>{{cite news |title=WASS SIGNs FOR 4 YEARS |trans-title=WASS SIGNE POUR 4 ANS |url=http://www.etgfc.com/2012/06/20/wass-signe-pour-4-ans/ |publisher=The Official Website of Evian Thonon Gaillard |language=fr |date=20 June 2012 |access-date=12 February 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120625115920/http://www.etgfc.com/2012/06/20/wass-signe-pour-4-ans/ |archive-date=25 June 2012}}</ref> On 12 August 2012, in the opening game of the season against [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]], Wass scored a free kick in a match that ended in a 2–3 loss for Evian.
