Silva began his senior club career in 2002 playing as a midfielder for [[Pedrabranca Futebol Clube|RS Futebol]], and transitioned to a defensive position while at [[Esporte Clube Juventude|Juventude]]; he then signed with [[FC Porto B|Porto]] in 2004, at age 19, and moved to [[FC Dynamo Moscow|Dynamo Moscow]] on [[Loan (sports)|loan]], where he was hospitalized with a near fatal bout of [[tuberculosis]]. After recovering, he joined [[Fluminense FC|Fluminense]] and won a [[Copa do Brasil]]. In 2009, Silva moved to [[A.C. Milan|AC Milan]] for a reported fee of €8 million and won a [[List of Italian football champions|Serie A]] title.

In 2012, Silva was the subject of a then-[[List of most expensive association football transfers|record association football transfer]] when he signed for [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] in a [[Transfer (association football)|transfer]] worth up to €42 million, becoming the most expensive defender ever at the time. There, he won seven [[List of French football champions|Ligue 1]] titles, six [[Coupe de la Ligue|Coupes de la Ligue]], five [[Coupe de France|Coupes de France]], and reached the [[2020 UEFA Champions League Final]].

In 2020, he signed for Chelsea on a [[Free transfer (association football)|free transfer]], and won the [[UEFA Champions League]] in his first season at the club.

Silva made his senior international debut for Brazil in 2008, at age 23, and has since earned over 110 caps, including appearing in eight major tournaments. He won a bronze medal in the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2008 Olympics]] and a silver medal at the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2012 Olympics]], and later served as captain as Brazil won the [[2013 FIFA Confederations Cup]] and finished fourth at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. Silva later helped his country win the [[2019 Copa América]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
When he was younger, Silva was admitted into a school in the [[Campo Grande, Rio de Janeiro|Campo Grande]] neighborhood of [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]] – coincidentally a feeder school for [[Fluminense Football Club|Fluminense]]. At the age of 14, Silva impressed Fluminense coach Maurinho during a friendly in [[Xerém]]. He was given a short trial, where he was given the role of a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]]. Silva's playing opportunities were few, prompting him to trial for other clubs. In 1999, at the age of 15, Silva auditioned at [[Madureira Esporte Clube|Madureira]], [[Olaria Esporte Clube|Olaria]], and [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]]; he was rejected at each club, the trial at Flamengo being the most difficult for him as he was not even observed by coaches.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.noticiasfla.com.br/2013/05/thiago-silva-revela-nao-aprovado-flamengo-botafogo.html|title=Thiago Silva revela nao ter sido aprovado no Flamengo e Botafogo|date=31 May 2013|access-date=21 June 2014|archive-date=14 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714124150/http://www.noticiasfla.com.br/2013/05/thiago-silva-revela-nao-aprovado-flamengo-botafogo.html|url-status=dead}}</ref>

After another unsuccessful trial at [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas|Botafogo]], Silva was taken on by his hometown side [[Barcelona Esporte Clube|Barcelona]], a small Brazilian club in the lower divisions. The following year, Silva played at a showcase tournament in [[São Paulo]] in the hope of attracting the attention of bigger clubs. It is there where he was spotted by [[Paulo César Carpegiani]], who invited him to join [[Pedrabranca Futebol Clube|RS Futebol]] in the south of Brazil. Joining the club in the end of 2001, Silva became a professional in 2002 and competed in the [[Campeonato Gaúcho Série B|third division of the Campeonato Gaúcho]], finishing second and achieving promotion to the state's [[Campeonato Gaúcho Série A2|second division]]. In a tournament played in [[Ancona]], Italy, Silva was spotted by [[Bruno Conti]], a coach with [[A.S. Roma|Roma]]. Conti wanted him to play for Roma, but Silva did not accept the offer.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.pariskop.fr/actualite/thiago-silva-lhistoire-dun-genie/8825|title=Thiago Silva : L'Histoire d'un génie|date=1 November 2013|access-date=21 June 2014}}</ref> Strong performances in his last season as a defensive midfielder led to Silva's move to [[Esporte Clube Juventude|Juventude]].<ref name="globoesporte.globo.com">{{cite news|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/programas/esporte-espetacular/noticia/2013/06/origens-thiago-silva-abre-o-jogo-e-se-emociona-ao-lembrar-das-dificuldades.html|title=Origens: Thiago Silva abre o jogo e se emociona ao lembrar das dificuldades|date=2 June 2013|access-date=21 June 2014}}</ref>

Silva moved to Juventude in 2004, where he played for six months. At 20 years old, Silva transitioned from midfield to defence under the tutelage of [[Ivo Wortmann]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://esporte.hsw.uol.com.br/jogador-thiago-silva.htm|title=Jogadores de futebol – Thiago Silva|access-date=21 June 2014|archive-date=17 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160917200608/http://esporte.hsw.uol.com.br/jogador-thiago-silva.htm|url-status=dead}}</ref> In his only season at Juventude, Silva was regarded as the revelation of the season.

Silva's performances had caught the eye of many clubs with his outstanding performances, and he was sold to [[FC Porto|Porto]].

Silva was bought by Porto for €2.5 million in 2004,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=272249.html |title=Derlei leads Dinamo influx |date=10 January 2005 |access-date=21 June 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090323001910/http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind%3D2/newsid%3D272249.html |archive-date=23 March 2009 }}</ref> but played only for the reserve team.

===Fluminense===
Silva returned to football with the help of his former coach, Ivo Wortmann. In 2006, Wortmann was signed as a coach by Fluminense and requested to bring Silva with him, despite Silva's health issues.<ref name="globoesporte.globo.com"/> On 14 January, Fluminense announced the signing of Silva from Dynamo Moscow.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.flogao.com.br/siriflu/41331122|title=Fluminense anuncia contratação do zagueiro Thiago Silva|date=15 January 2006|access-date=21 June 2014|archive-date=31 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531075659/http://www.flogao.com.br/siriflu/41331122|url-status=dead}}</ref> Fluminense struggled in the [[2006 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|2006 Brasileirão]], finishing 15th out of 20 teams; however, Silva was described as one of the best players in the season.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://esporte.uol.com.br/futebol/ultimas/2006/11/25/ult59u107805.jhtm|title= Torcedor do Flu, Thiago Silva já foi vascaíno|date=25 November 2006|access-date=21 June 2014}}</ref> It is during this time where Silva developed the nickname of "''O Monstro''" — Portuguese for "The Monster".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sport24.lefigaro.fr/football/ligue-des-champions/actualites/thiago-silva-est-vraiment-un-monstre-625379|title= Thiago Silva est vraiment un "Monstre"|date=3 April 2013|access-date=21 June 2014}}</ref>

2007 was a much better year for both Fluminense and for Silva. The club finished in fourth place in the [[2007 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|2007 Brasileirão]], conceding only 39 goals in 38 matches, enough for the second-best defence in Brazil. More importantly, Fluminense managed a historic victory in the [[2007 Copa do Brasil]], winning the prestigious trophy for the first time. Silva played a decisive part in the victory; he started in every match, and scored the opening goal in the quarter-final, as well as the equalising goal in the semi-final.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.flumania.com.br/cpbrasil2007b.htm|title=Copa do Brasil 2007 – 2ª Parte|access-date=21 June 2014}}</ref> Silva's form through the season led him to be selected into [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national team]] manager [[Dunga]]'s preliminary squad for the [[2007 Copa América]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://esporte.uol.com.br/futebol/ultimas/2007/05/28/ult59u121784.jhtm|title=Dunga pré-convoca Zé Roberto e surpresas para Copa América|date=28 May 2007|access-date=21 June 2014}}</ref> After winning the [[2007 Copa do Brasil|Copa do Brasil]], Silva was recognised by fans as the best defender in Brazil.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/ESP/Noticia/Futebol/Fluminense/0,,MUL48900-4284,00-CHORO+EUFORIA+E+REDENCAO+NAS+LARANJEIRAS.html|title=Choro, euforia e redenção nas Laranjeiras|date=7 June 2007|access-date=21 June 2014}}</ref> At the end of the season, he was one of three nominees for the Best Central Defender award, alongside [[Breno Borges|Breno]] and [[Fábio Luciano]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/ESP/Noticia/Futebol/Campeonatos/0,,MUL188549-4276,00-OS+FINALISTAS+DO+CRAQUE+BRASILEIRAO.html|title=Os finalistas do Craque Brasileirão 2007|date=22 November 2007|access-date=21 June 2014}}</ref> The voting results were unveiled on 4 December, where Silva finished second, behind Breno.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite news|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/ESP/Noticia/Futebol/Campeonatos/0,,MUL202192-4276,00-BRENO+E+O+MELHOR+ZAGUEIRO+PELA+DIREITA.html|title=Breno é o melhor zagueiro pela direita|date=4 December 2007|access-date=21 June 2014}}</ref>

2008 was a bad year for Fluminense, but Silva's best on an individual level. Having devoted much of their efforts towards the [[2008 Copa Libertadores]], the club's league form suffered, finishing in 14th place. On 18 January, Silva was rewarded by Fluminense's board of directors for his 100th match in the ''tricolor'': He was awarded a shirt with the number "100" and a plaque in honour of his achievements.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://esporte.uol.com.br/futebol/ultimas/2008/01/19/ult59u143326.jhtm|title=Thiago Silva é homenageado pela diretoria do Fluminense|date=19 January 2008|access-date=21 June 2014}}</ref> Silva became an idol for young Fluminense supporters with his level of performances — the white wristband that Silva would wear during matches became a trend amongst teenagers in Rio de Janeiro who supported the ''tricolor''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/ESP/Noticia/Futebol/Fluminense/0,,MUL265485-4284,00-THIAGOMANIA+O+ORGULHO+DO+CRAQUE+TRICOLOR.html|title=Thiagomania, o orgulho do craque tricolor|date=18 January 2008|access-date=21 June 2014}}</ref> In May 2008, four fans painted a flag of Silva to honour what they deemed "the best central defender in Brazil".
