'''Aliou Cissé''' (born 24 March 1976) is a Senegalese [[Association football|football]] coach and former player who is the manager of the [[Senegal national football team|Senegal national team]]. Cissé is best known for captaining the Senegal team which reached the [[2002 Africa Cup of Nations Final]] and for being the first Senegal manager to win the tournament in [[2022 Africa Cup of Nations|2022]] after reaching the final in [[2019 Africa Cup of Nations|2019]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Senegal 0-1 Algeria: Baghdad Bounedjah's second-minute goal seals Africa Cup of Nations title|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/13962/11766582/senegal-0-1-algeria-baghdad-bounedjahs-second-minute-goal-seals-africa-cup-of-nations-title|access-date=7 February 2022|website=Sky Sports|language=en}}</ref><ref name=":0" />

Having begun his career in France, he later played for English clubs [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]]. Cissé was a defensive midfielder who also, on occasion, played at centre back.

Cissé has been the head coach of [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] since 2015, having briefly taken charge of them following [[Amara Traoré]]'s sacking, in a caretaker role in 2012. He was also the assistant coach of the [[Senegal national under-23 football team|under-23 side]] from 2012 to 2013, becoming head coach from 2013 to 2015.

==Club career==
Born in [[Ziguinchor]], Senegal, Cissé moved to Paris at the age of nine where he grew up with dreams of playing for [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Cissé Aliou |url=http://www.paris-canalhistorique.com/cisse-aliou/ |website=Paris.canal-historique |access-date=24 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624222934/http://www.paris-canalhistorique.com/cisse-aliou/ |archive-date=24 June 2018 |language=fr |date=13 February 2013}}</ref> He began his career with [[Lille OSC]] before moving onto [[CS Sedan Ardennes]] and then Paris Saint-Germain. He also spent the majority of the 2001–02 season on loan at [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier Herault SC]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Aliou Cisse Histoire |url=http://www.mhscfoot.com/joueur/aliou-cisse/histoire |website=mhscfoot.com |access-date=25 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407200444/http://www.mhscfoot.com/joueur/aliou-cisse/histoire |archive-date=7 April 2016 |language=fr}}</ref>

After captaining the [[Senegal national football team|Senegal national team]] to the quarter-finals of the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], Cissé transferred to English club [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] for their [[2002–03 Birmingham City F.C. season|2002–03 season]], their debut season in the [[Premier League]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Aliou Cisse signs for Birmingham |url=http://zeenews.india.com/home/aliou-cisse-signs-for-birmingham_48728.html |website=[[Zee News]] |publisher=[[Zee Media Corporation Limited]] |access-date=24 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624224514/http://zeenews.india.com/home/aliou-cisse-signs-for-birmingham_48728.html |archive-date=24 June 2018 |date=10 July 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ireland|first1=Shane|title=Aliou Cissue: The former Birmingham City midfielder now managing Senegal at World Cup 2018|url=https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/cisse-senegal-blues-world-cup-12795402|website=[[Birmingham Mail]]|publisher=[[Reach plc]]|access-date=22 June 2018|date=20 June 2018}}</ref> Cissé made his first appearance for the club at [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] on the opening day of the season, but was sent off. Though the sending-off was rescinded,<ref>{{cite news |title=Cisse red card rescinded|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/2204613.stm|website=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=BBC|access-date=22 June 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020823171049/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/2204613.stm|archive-date=23 August 2002|date=20 August 2002}}</ref> he went on to receive five yellow cards in six games, ultimately accumulating ten yellow cards before the New Year. His season, however, was cut short after picking up an injury in February that ruled him out for the rest of the season.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Ireland |first1=Shane |title=Aliou Cisse - here's what happened to a Birmingham City favourite |url=https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/other/aliou-cisse-what-happened-next-to-the-birmingham-city-favourite/ar-BByHNlZ |website=[[MSN]] |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |access-date=24 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180624231530/https://www.msn.com/en-gb/news/other/aliou-cisse-what-happened-next-to-the-birmingham-city-favourite/ar-BByHNlZ |archive-date=24 June 2018 |date=5 February 2018}}</ref>

Cissé returned late to pre-season training in July 2003, which led manager [[Steve Bruce]] to place him on the transfer list. Cissé eventually got himself back into the first team picture, but his relationship with Bruce continued to sour. After Christmas, Cissé only played three more games that season. At the end of the season he signed for [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] for £300,000 on a two-year contract, despite a strong transfer link to Premiership rivals [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. The transfer was ultimately one of several included in the [[2006 English football corruption investigation#Stevens report|Stevens report]] released in June 2007, which expressed concerns of corruption within English football. Regarding Cissé, the report stated, "Agent [[Willie McKay]] acted for Portsmouth in the transfer of Cissé and [...] the inquiry is not prepared to clear these transfers at this stage".<ref>{{cite news |title = What Stevens said about each club |publisher = www.telegraph.co.uk|date = 16 June 2007|url =https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&grid=A1YourView&xml=/sport/2007/06/16/sfnste116.xml

==International career==
Cissé captained the [[Senegal national football team|Senegal national team]] at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. After a 1–0 victory over reigning world champions [[France national football team|France]] on matchday one,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Glendenning |first1=Barry |title=World Cup 2002: France 0 - 1 Senegal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/may/31/minutebyminute.worldcupfootball2002 |website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=22 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180109064123/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/may/31/minutebyminute.worldcupfootball2002 |archive-date=9 January 2018 |date=31 May 2002}}</ref> the team made it all the way to the quarter-finals where they lost 1–0 to [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Glendenning |first1=Barry |title=World Cup 2002: Turkey 1 - 0 Senegal |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jun/22/minutebyminute.worldcupfootball20021 |website=[[The Guardian]] |access-date=22 June 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160407095027/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2002/jun/22/minutebyminute.worldcupfootball20021 |archive-date=7 April 2016 |date=22 June 2002}}</ref> Cissé was also part of the Senegal team who were the runners-up in the [[2002 African Cup of Nations]], but was one of the players who missed a penalty during the shootout in the final as they lost to [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/cup_of_nations/1812787.stm|title=Cameroon retain Cup|publisher=BBC|date=10 February 2002 |access-date=5 October 2017}}</ref>

==Managerial career==
