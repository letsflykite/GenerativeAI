Through our work to protect the rights of FIFA World Cup workers in Qatar, FIFA and the Supreme Committee are aware of the importance of wage protection measures in the country and this is why we have put in place robust systems to prevent and mitigate wage abuse on FIFA World Cup sites, as well as mechanisms for workers to raise potential grievances and practices to provide for remediation where companies fail to live up to our standards”.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Qatar 2022 organiser launches Workers' Welfare website |url=https://www.business-humanrights.org/en/latest-news/qatar-2022-organiser-launches-workers-welfare-website/ |access-date=2022-09-27 |website=Business & Human Rights Resource Centre |language=en}}</ref>
