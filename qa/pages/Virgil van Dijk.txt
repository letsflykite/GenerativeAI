Neil McGuinness, senior scout at Celtic when Van Dijk was signed, called him "everything you would want if you could create a profile of the ideal central defender", praising him as a "very smooth ball-playing defender" who possesses aerial prowess, skills from dead ball situations, and "strong leadership qualities", while commenting that since his move to England, he is "more tactically aware now [...] his anticipation and timing has improved and he is a lot more of an all-rounder".<ref name=NMcG/> McGuinness believes Van Dijk's "biggest problem" is that he "can switch off when the game is comfortable".<ref name=NMcG/> In 2018, Steve Douglas of ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' described Van Dijk with the following words: "Powerful in the air, measured with the ball at his feet, quick, and with superb positional sense, van Dijk [''sic''] has it all."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/soccer/article-man-u-face-down-virgil-van-dijk-the-type-of-defender-they-desperately/ |title=Man U face Virgil Van Dijk, the type of defender they desperately lack, in key Liverpool match |newspaper=The Globe and Mail |last1=Douglas |first1=Steve |date=13 December 2018 |access-date=23 June 2020 |archive-date=16 September 2021 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210916192653/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/soccer/article-man-u-face-down-virgil-van-dijk-the-type-of-defender-they-desperately/ |url-status=live }}</ref> Dario Pergolizzi also described Van Dijk as a good marker in 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.ultimouomo.com/van-dijk-liverpool-analisi-2018-19/ |title=L'affare van Dijk |website=Ultimo Uomo |language=it |last1=Pergolizzi |first1=Dario |date=28 March 2019 |access-date=23 June 2020 |archive-date=27 October 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201027205141/https://www.ultimouomo.com/van-dijk-liverpool-analisi-2018-19/ |url-status=live }}</ref>

In a 2019 interview with ''[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]'', when Lionel Messi was asked why Van Dijk was so difficult to beat, the Argentine responded: "He is a defender who knows how to judge his timing and wait for the right moment to challenge or jockey [the attacker]. He is very fast and big, but he has a lot of agility for his height. He is fast because of its [sic] great stride, and he is impressive both in defence and attack because he scores lots of goals."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.marca.com/en/football/barcelona/2019/10/17/5da81c0122601d1b308b458c.html |title=Messi: The body rules and I have to take more care of myself than before |newspaper=Marca |last1=Gallardo |first1=Juan Ignacio |last2=Rojo |first2=Luis F. |date=17 October 2019 |access-date=17 October 2019 |archive-date=17 October 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191017161142/https://www.marca.com/en/football/barcelona/2019/10/17/5da81c0122601d1b308b458c.html |url-status=live }}</ref> That same year, [[Paul Merson]] described Van Dijk as "the best in the world, and I think by a long way, as a defensive centre-half."<ref name ="best defender-sky"/>

==Personal life==
Van Dijk commonly uses only his first name on the kit.

Van Dijk has [[Chinese Surinamese|Chinese]] ancestry. Hellen Chin Fo Sieeuw, his mother, is of part-Chinese descent.
