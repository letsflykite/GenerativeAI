==Style of play==
Carvalho plays primarily as a [[defensive midfielder]], although he can also be deployed as a [[central midfielder]] or a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]]. Known for his passing range and accuracy, ability to control a game and composure on the pitch, he earned praise for his imposing physicality.<ref name=ESPN>{{cite web|url=http://en.espn.co.uk/football/sport/story/330409.html|title=Vieira-like Carvalho perfect for Arsenal dream team|publisher=ESPN|first=James|last=McNicholas|date=7 August 2014|access-date=25 December 2018}}</ref>
