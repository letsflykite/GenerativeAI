Despite his first two seasons being highly successful, having ended the 2010 season with an impressive 42 goals in 60 games, problems had been identified, namely Neymar's apparent taste for diving when tackled, rather than attempting to continue his run, and his attitude. The latter came to the forefront during a match with [[Atlético Clube Goianiense|Atlético Goianiense]], on 15 September 2010, when the Santos' manager, [[Dorival Júnior]], appointed another player to take the penalty awarded for a foul on Neymar. His decision was based on the fact that Neymar had missed a crucial penalty during the [[Copa do Brasil 2010#Final phase|Copa do Brasil final]] of that year, even if Santos went on to win. Reacting to this, Neymar turned his back on his manager, had to be calmed down by a linesman and argued with his captain, [[Edu Dracena]]. The fallout from this event was that Dorival Júnior wished to have Neymar suspended for two weeks, but the board sided with the player and promptly sacked the manager. Despite Neymar's apologies over the incident, some doubts still remain about his attitude.<ref name="Back Page" /> In December 2010, aged just 18, Neymar came third for the [[2010 South American Footballer of the Year]], behind [[Andrés D'Alessandro]] and [[Juan Sebastián Verón]].<ref>[https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/30122010/2/d-alessandro-named-latin-america-player-year.html "D'Alessandro named Latin America player of the year"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140523012746/https://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/30122010/2/d-alessandro-named-latin-america-player-year.html |date=23 May 2014 }}.

===Music===
Neymar has become an icon in promoting Brazilian modern pop music, particularly [[Música sertaneja]]. The video in which Neymar dances in the [[Santos FC|Santos]] [[locker room]] dancing in front of teammates carrying his recorder making the round of the players and making them react to the tune of [[Michel Teló]]'s hit "[[Ai se eu te pego!]]" went [[viral video|viral]]. He made a point of performing his dance antics to the song after scoring goals in football games and appeared live with Teló in one of the latter's concerts. He also supported sertanejo singer [[Gusttavo Lima]] performing live with Lima on renditions of the singer's hits "[[Balada (song)|Balada]]" and "Fazer Beber". In 2012, he made cameo appearances in the [[music video]] for yet another sertanejo hit "[[Eu Quero Tchu, Eu Quero Tcha]]" by [[João Lucas & Marcelo]]. In 2013, Neymar appeared on a rap music video, "País do Futebol" by [[MC Guimê]].<ref>[http://www.foxsports.com.br/noticias/139820-parca-de-neymar-mc-guime-explica-sucesso-de-pais-do-futebol "'Parça’ de Neymar, MC Guimê explica sucesso de ‘País do Futebol’"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924015338/http://www.foxsports.com.br/noticias/139820-parca-de-neymar-mc-guime-explica-sucesso-de-pais-do-futebol |date=24 September 2015 }}.
