==Club career==
===Early career===
Vinícius Junior's football career began in 2006, when his father took him to the branch offices of Flamengo, in the neighborhood of Mutuá, in [[São Gonçalo, Rio de Janeiro|São Gonçalo]] where he lived. His club document described him as a left-back.

Hailing from a poor [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] family,<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-06-20 |title=Real Madrid: Meet Vinicius in 44 responses: The 'dancinhas,' his idol Asensio, his desire... |url=https://www.marca.com/en/football/real-madrid/2018/06/20/5b2a19c646163fd8488b4571.html |access-date=2022-12-22 |website=MARCA in English |language=en}}</ref> Vinícius went to live in [[Abolição]] with his uncle, Ulisses, to shorten the distance to [[Ninho do Urubu]] (the "Vultures' Nest"). He started to receive financial aid from Flamengo as well as aid from entrepreneurs.<ref name="origin">{{cite web|title=Flamengo dá aumento de salário e eleva multa de Vinícius Júnior para 45 mi de euros|url=https://globoesporte.globo.com/futebol/times/flamengo/noticia/o-comeco-de-tudo-onde-o-fominha-vinicius-junior-deu-seus-primeiros-chapeus.ghtml|website=Globo Esporte|date=4 April 2017|access-date=7 June 2018|language=pt}}</ref>

Between 2007 and 2010, Vinícius attended [[futsal]] classes at Flamengo's school in São Gonçalo at the Canto do Rio, a famous club located in the centre of Niterói.{{cn|date=December 2022}}

In 2009, when Vinícius was nine, he took a futsal trial for Flamengo. The club noted his potential, but given his young age, he was asked to come back the following year. However, he decided he wanted to play football, not futsal, and did not return. In August 2010, Vinícius passed his football tests at Flamengo.{{cn|date=December 2022}}
