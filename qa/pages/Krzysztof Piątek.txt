Regarded as an important player for the national team and ready to play alongside [[Robert Lewandowski]] and [[Arkadiusz Milik]] in an attacking trio, Piątek was forced to miss the postponed [[Euro 2020]] due to ankle injury in May 2021 that required surgery and months of rehabilitation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pzpn.pl/reprezentacje/reprezentacja-a/aktualnosci/2021-05-14/krzysztof-piatek-nie-zagra-na-uefa-euro-2020-dluga-przerwa-polaka|title = Krzysztof Piątek nie zagra na UEFA EURO 2020! Długa przerwa Polaka - Reprezentacja A}}</ref>

== Style of play ==
Piątek has been described as a "classic" "number 9" [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]] most efficient inside the opponent's penalty area, courtesy of his excellent positioning, accurate finishing, height, physical strength, and tenacity in aerial or physical challenges with opponents.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.esquire.com/it/sport/calcio/a25945576/piatek-milan-genoa/|title=Piatek spacca la porta|trans-title=Piatek smashes the door|language=it|website=esquire.com|publisher=Hearst Magazines|date=18 January 2019|access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref> His team play outside the penalty area and playmaking abilities have been cited as areas in need of improvement, however.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.esquire.com/it/sport/calcio/a28920987/piatek-milan-crisi|title=Che succede, Krzysztof?|trans-title=What's going on, Krzysztof?|language=it|website=esquire.com|publisher=Hearst Magazines|date=5 September 2019|access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.alfredopedulla.com/piatek-non-e-facile-adattarsi-al-gioco-di-giampaolo-sul-numero-9-paqueta-e-quagliarella-2|title=Piatek: "Non è facile adattarsi al gioco di Giampaolo.

During his time in Genoa, Piątek played in a [[Formation (association football)#3–5–2|3–5–2]] formation as a main striker, usually on the left, most often supported by [[Christian Kouamé]], a pacey forward with excellent dribbling and passing skills. In Milan, he became a lone striker in a [[Formation (association football)#4–3–3|4–3–3]] formation, supported by wingers on either side of the pitch.

Piątek has named [[Harry Kane]] and [[Robert Lewandowski]] as his two favourite strikers who he wishes to emulate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimouomo.com/come-gioca-krzysztof-piatek|title=Il giocatore di settembre: Krzysztof Piatek|trans-title=The September player: Krzysztof Piatek|language=it|website=ultimouomo.com|publisher=L'Ultimo Uomo|date=5 October 2018|access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref> He has also cited [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and [[Thierry Henry]] as his childhood inspirations. {{Citation needed|date=July 2021}}
