'''Remo Marco Freuler''' (born 15 April 1992) is a Swiss professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Premier League]] club [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] and the [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland national team]].

==Club career==
Freuler began his youth career with FC [[Hinwil]] and moved to fellow [[Canton of Zürich|Zürich]] side [[FC Winterthur]] in 2005. Freuler made his professional debut with Winterthur at the age of 18 in 2010, making two substitute appearances at the end of the [[2009–10 Swiss Challenge League]]. That summer, Freuler was transferred to [[Grasshopper Club Zürich]], where he spent most of the season with the under-21 side. He did spend a stint with the professional club toward the beginning of the [[2010–11 Swiss Super League|Super League]] season, and got on the scoresheet against rivals [[FC Zürich]]. Freuler was frozen out of the team the following season, and was loaned back to Winterthur in the winter break.<ref name="Blick">{{cite web |url=https://www.blick.ch/sport/fussball/international/serie-a/freuler-herrscht-mamma-mia-ein-nati-neuling-mischt-italien-auf-id6579001.html |title=Freuler herrscht! Mamma mia – ein Nati-Neuling mischt Italien auf |work=Blick |first=Martin |last=Arn |date=25 April 2017}}</ref>

===Winterthur===
Freuler joined a Winterthur side in tenth place in the [[2011–12 Swiss Challenge League|Challenge League]] after the first half of the season, just two points above the relegation zone. He made 14 appearances that season for Winterthur, highlighted by his first career goals for the club in the form of a brace against [[SC Kriens|Kriens]] on 4 March 2012, and Winterthur finished in fourth place. Freuler started all but two games in the [[2012–13 Swiss Challenge League|2012–13 season]] as Winterthur finished in third. Freuler's contract with Winterthur was made permanent in the summer, and he made 21 more appearances with the club the next season before moving to [[Swiss Super League|Super League]] side [[FC Luzern]].

===Luzern===
On 18 February 2014, Freuler was transferred to Luzern, and he made his club debut on 2 March against [[FC St. Gallen|St. Gallen]] under manager [[Carlos Bernegger]]. Freuler scored his first goal for the club against [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]] on 6 April, and Luzern finished the [[2013–14 Swiss Super League|2013–14 season]] in fourth place.

Freuler scored seven goals and provided five assists the following season for Luzern, who made a resurgence under new manager [[Markus Babbel]] following a mid-season sacking of Bernegger and finishing the first half of the season bottom of the table. Freuler started every game of the new season under Babbel before being transferred to Italian club [[Atalanta B.C.]]

===Atalanta===
[[File:Azione Lecce Atalanta - Remo Freuler (cropped).jpg|thumb|Freuler [[captain (association football)|captain]]ing Atalanta in 2020]]

On 19 January 2016, Freuler moved to Atalanta for a €2 million transfer fee, and he made his [[Serie A]] debut on 7 February against [[Empoli F.C.|Empoli]]. After being substituted off against [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] the next week, Freuler was an unused substitute by manager [[Edoardo Reja|Edy Reja]] the next seven matches until making his return to the starting eleven two months later against [[A.S. Roma|Roma]].<ref name="Blick" /> After the match, an Italian journalist gave him the nickname ''Iceman'', which Freuler said was "because I was so calm on the ball".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.20min.ch/sport/fussball/story/In-Italien-nennen-sie-ihn--Iceman--10692508 |title=In Italien nennen sie ihn "Iceman" |trans-title=In Italy they call him "Iceman" |work=[[20 Minuten]] |first=Eva |last=Tedesco |date=8 November 2016}}</ref> He scored his first goal for the [[Bergamo]] side on 2 May against eventual runners-up [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]].

Freuler made 29 starts in the [[2016–17 Serie A|2016–17 season]], in which Atalanta finished fourth in the table, a nine place improvement under first-year manager [[Gian Piero Gasperini]]. Atalanta also qualified for the group stages of the [[2017–18 UEFA Europa League#Group stage|Europa League]] for the first time since [[1990–91 UEFA Cup|1990]]. Freuler found his name on the scoresheet five times, and also provided four assists. On 28 April, Freuler scored a late equaliser at home to eventual champions [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], derailing their chance to clinch the ''Scudetto'' that weekend.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurosport.com/football/late-remo-freuler-goal-gets-atalanta-a-point-and-denies-serie-a-leaders-juventus_sto6146603/story.shtml |title=Late Remo Freuler goal gets Atalanta a point and denies Serie A leaders Juventus |work=Eurosport |date=29 April 2017}}</ref>

Freuler made his first Europa League group stage appearance against English side [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], playing the full 90 minutes in a 3–0 victory over the ''Toffees''. He had previously played in a second round qualification two-legged tie against Scottish club [[St Johnstone F.C.|St Johnstone]] for Luzern. He opened his scoring account in the [[2017–18 Serie A|2017–18 season]] with Atalanta against [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], scoring an equaliser in the fourth minute of stoppage time on 24 September 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://us.soccerway.com/matches/2017/09/24/italy/serie-a/acf-fiorentina/atalanta-bergamo/2538829/|title = Fiorentina vs. Atalanta - 24 September 2017 - Soccerway}}</ref>

===Nottingham Forest===
On 14 August 2022, Freuler joined newly-promoted [[Premier League]] club [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], leaving Atalanta after six and a half seasons.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nottinghamforest.co.uk/news/2022/august/14/remo-freuler-signs-for-the-reds/ |title=Nottingham Forest FC – Remo Freuler signs for The Reds |publisher=Nottingham Forest F.C. |date=14 August 2022 |access-date=14 August 2022}}</ref>

==International career==
Freuler came through the youth setup in Switzerland before being called up to the [[Switzerland national football team|senior squad]] for the first time during Switzerland's [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]] [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|qualifying campaign]]. He was included in the [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland national team]] 23-man [[2018 FIFA World Cup squads#Switzerland|squad]] for the 2018 World Cup.<ref>{{cite news| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/sports/dcunited/switzerland-opts-for-experience-in-world-cup-squad/2018/06/04/86572ee2-680a-11e8-a335-c4503d041eaf_story.html| title = - The Washington Post| newspaper = [[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>

==Style of play==
Freuler mainly plays as a central midfielder for club and country. He is considered an effective and versatile player who recovers the ball, tackles well and has a good range of passing. [[Il Giorno (newspaper)|''Il Giorno'']] correspondent Fabrizio Carcano described him as "the conductor of the orchestra" due to his high footballing intelligence.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Are Liverpool set to face Europe's most underrated player?|language=en-GB|work=BBC Sport|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/55042483|access-date=2 July 2021}}</ref>
