'''Jason Steven Cummings''' (born 1 August 1995) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]] for [[Indian Super League]] club [[Mohun Bagan AC|Mohun Bagan SG]]. Born in Scotland, he represents the [[Australia men's national soccer team|Australia national team]], after previously representing Scotland at youth and senior international level.

Cummings started his professional career with [[Hibernian F.C.|Hibernian]], making 16 appearances and scoring twice in the 2013–14 season. He was their top goalscorer over each of the next three seasons, scoring more than 20 goals each season, making him the first player to achieve this feat for over 50 years. These goals helped Hibs win the [[Scottish Cup]] in [[2015–16 Scottish Cup|2016]] and promotion in [[2016–17 Scottish Championship|2017]]. He moved to Nottingham Forest in June 2017, but did not play regularly for their first team and was loaned to [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in January 2018, [[Peterborough United F.C.|Peterborough United]] in July 2018 and Luton Town in January 2019.  After a spell with [[Shrewsbury Town F.C.|Shrewsbury Town]], Cummings signed for [[Dundee F.C.|Dundee]] in 2021 and with them he would once again gain promotion to the [[Scottish Premiership]]. In 2022 Cummings signed for Australian club [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]].

He made his first full international appearance for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] in November 2017, but subsequently made himself available for selection by Australia. Cummings made his first appearance for them in September 2022, and was then selected in their [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cup]] squad.
