'''Christopher Ross Gunter''' (born 21 July 1989) is a Welsh former [[Association football|footballer]] who last played as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] for {{English football updater|AFCWimbl}} club [[AFC Wimbledon]]. An attacking [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|full back]], he was capable of playing on both flanks but usually played on his preferred right side. Since 2023, he has been a coach for the [[Wales national football team|Wales national team]].

He joined [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]'s youth system and was signed by [[Premier League]] club [[Tottenham Hotspur]] for £4 million in January 2008. Rarely used at Tottenham, he returned to the Championship with [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]], initially on loan, before joining [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] in 2012. He made 314 appearances for Reading before being released in 2020 and moving to [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]] and [[AFC Wimbledon]].

Gunter was a Welsh international since [[Wales national under-17 football team|under-17 level]] and holds the record as the second youngest debutant for the [[Wales national under-21 football team|under-21 team]]. He made his full international debut in 2007, earning 109 caps in a 15-year international career. He was part of the Wales squad that reached the semi-finals at [[UEFA Euro 2016]], also featuring at [[UEFA Euro 2020|Euro 2020]] and in the [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cup]] squad. In 2017 he was named [[Welsh Footballer of the Year]]. He beat [[Neville Southall]]'s record of 92 caps in 2018, and in 2021 became the first Welshman to earn [[List of men's footballers with 100 or more international caps|100 caps]].
