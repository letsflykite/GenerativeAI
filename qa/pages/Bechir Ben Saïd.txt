== International career ==

Ben Saïd - Profile with news, career statistics and history|url=https://int.soccerway.com/players/bechir-ben-said/377591/|access-date=19 January 2022|website=Soccerway}}</ref> During this competition, he officiates as a substitute goalkeeper and does not play any matches. Tunisia lost in the final against [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]].

He was later named into the Tunisian squad yet again for the [[2021 Africa Cup of Nations]] in Cameroon, with initial expectation to be a substitute goalkeeper, he ended up being the main keeper of Tunisia throughout the group stage as Tunisia had a somewhat disappointing performance, only qualified as one of the best third-placed team with one lone win.
