Dominant in the air, he is blessed with strength, fine distribution and composure, and is able to play out from the back thanks to his confidence in possession, while his intelligent positioning helps him deny pacy forwards. With his ability to read the game, he could even play in midfield. His leadership also stands him out: he was 18 when he was made Ajax skipper."<ref name="How brilliant is"/> That same year, Paul Wilkes of ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote that "De Ligt's ability to play out from the back and organise his fellow teammates are valuable commodities in a time when the lack of quality defenders has been highlighted."<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/ajax-vs-juventus-matthijs-de-ligt-interview-best-young-defender-champions-league-dutch-football-a8862111.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220512/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/ajax-vs-juventus-matthijs-de-ligt-interview-best-young-defender-champions-league-dutch-football-a8862111.html |archive-date=12 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Ajax vs Juventus: Meet Matthijs de Ligt, the best young defender on the planet and the future of Dutch football |newspaper=The Independent |last1=Wilkes |first1=Paul |date=10 April 2019 |access-date=23 June 2020 }}</ref>

Former [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[England national football team|England]] defender [[Jamie Carragher]] praised De Ligt for his "physical attributes" and "leadership qualities". Carragher also said he plays "like he's 24 or 25" indicating maturity and strength.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/29327/11735758/virgil-van-dijk-and-matthijs-de-ligt-jamie-carragher-analyses-brilliant-netherlands-pair|title=Virgil van Dijk and Matthijs de Ligt: Jamie Carragher analyses brilliant Netherlands pair|website=Sky Sports |date=13 June 2019|access-date=13 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/jamie-carragher-reveals-what-saw-16269673|title=Carragher explains what he saw De Ligt do that really impressed him|newspaper=Daily Mirror|last=Polden|first=Jake|date=6 June 2019|access-date=13 June 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2019/06/06/liverpool-carragher-on-de-ligt-top-class/|title=Jamie Carragher shares honest opinion of reported Liverpool target Matthijs de Ligt|website=HITC|last=Labellarte|first=Giuseppe|language=en|date=6 June 2019|access-date=13 June 2019}}</ref> Of De Ligt, former Netherlands centre-back [[Jaap Stam]] said: "He's got composure on the ball, he's aggressive tactically, he sees the game, he reads the game well and he's got that driving force for himself as well in what you need to achieve and where you want to go to."<ref name="How brilliant is">{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/0253-0e99cefa43d0-8d411600d71f-1000--how-brilliant-is-new-juventus-signing-matthijs-de-ligt/ |title=How brilliant is new Juventus signing Matthijs de Ligt? |publisher=UEFA |last1=Mohamed |first1=Majid |date=19 July 2019 |access-date=23 June 2020 }}</ref> Upon signing with Juventus, [[Marcello Lippi]], one of the club's former managers, said of the defender's precocious performances: "I've seen plenty of greats, like [[Alessandro Nesta]], [[Franco Baresi]], [[Paolo Maldini]], [[Ciro Ferrara]], [[Fabio Cannavaro]], and [[Marco Materazzi]]. I've never seen anyone like that at his age."<ref name="How brilliant is"/>

In 2019, Giacomo Chiuchiolo described De Ligt as a "complete" and talented young defender, saying that although he is not exceptionally quick, he possesses excellent positioning and an ability to read the game, among his other technical and physical qualities.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://gianlucadimarzio.com/it/de-ligt-juventus-chi-e-come-gioca-calciomercato |title=De Ligt, dal tennis al tetto d'Europa: storia del talento che ha stregato la Juve |publisher=Gianluca di Marzio |language=it |last=Chiuchiolo |first=Giacomo |date=23 June 2019 |access-date=23 June 2020 }}</ref> Despite his talent, he has at times come under criticism in the media for being inconsistent due to his tendency to commit occasional lapses or errors. In October 2019, his [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] defensive teammate [[Leonardo Bonucci]] said he believes that De Ligt will overcome these weaknesses with time, as he matures and gains more experience with age, and successfully adapts to the team's new defensive strategy under manager [[Maurizio Sarri]], who uses a [[zonal marking]] system rather than [[man-to-man marking]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2859607-leonardo-bonucci-matthijs-de-ligt-will-become-the-best-defender-in-the-world |title=Leonardo Bonucci: Matthijs de Ligt 'Will Become the Best Defender in the World' |publisher=Bleacher Report |last1=Jones |first1=Matt |date=24 October 2019 |access-date=23 June 2020 }}</ref>

==Personal life==
De Ligt is in a relationship with Dutch model Annekee Molenaar, daughter of [[Keje Molenaar]].<ref>{{Cite news|date=8 December 2020|title=Annekee: "Io e Matthijs conquistati da Torino e dalle colline delle Langhe"|url=https://torino.repubblica.it/cronaca/2020/12/08/news/annekee_io_e_matthijs_conquistati_da_torino_e_dalle_colline_delle_langhe_-277475230/|access-date=2 February 2021|newspaper=la Repubblica|language=it}}</ref>
