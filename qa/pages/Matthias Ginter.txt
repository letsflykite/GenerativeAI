==Club career==
===Early career===
Ginter began his career with SV March before he moved to the youth squad of [[SC Freiburg]] for the 2005–06 season. With the under-19 team he won the Under-19 [[DFB-Pokal]] in 2011 and 2012.<ref>{{cite web |title=Junioren: Freiburg feiert Pokalsieg – Elfmeter-Krimi gegen Rostock |url=https://www.dfb.de/news/detail/junioren-freiburg-feiert-pokalsieg-elfmeter-krimi-gegen-rostock-27627/ |website=DFB |access-date=27 June 2022 |language=de |date=21 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=SC Freiburg feiert den vierten Pokalsieg – 2:1 gegen Hertha BSC |url=https://www.dfb.de/news/detail/sc-freiburg-feiert-den-vierten-pokalsieg-21-gegen-hertha-bsc-33356/ |website=DFB - Deutscher Fußball-Bund e.V. |access-date=27 June 2022 |language=de |date=12 May 2012}}</ref>

In January 2012, Ginter trained with Freiburg's first team due, in part, to a loss of several players from the roster during the winter transfer window.

In the 88th minute of the game, he scored the winning goal from a free-kick by [[Michael Lumb (footballer)|Michael Lumb]] for his team in the 1–0 victory.<ref>{{cite web|title=Freiburg tops fellow struggler Augsburg|url=http://msn.foxsports.com/foxsoccer/bundesliga/story/freiburg-1-0-augsburg-match-report-bundesliga-matthias-ginter-nails-winner-012112|work=foxsports.com|access-date=24 January 2012 | date = 21 January 2012}}</ref> The goal, which came two days after Ginter's 18th birthday, made him SCF's youngest Bundesliga goalscorer in the club's history.
