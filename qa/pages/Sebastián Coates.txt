===Liverpool===
[[File:Martin Kelly and Sebastian Coates.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Coates playing alongside [[Martin Kelly (footballer)|Martin Kelly]] against [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] in 2012.]]
In August 2011, Coates was the subject of substantial interest from [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]]. He was given permission to have a medical at [[Melwood]] ahead of his proposed move on 26 August, and the following day watched Liverpool's match against [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]].

===Sunderland===
[[File:Chelsea 3 Sunderland 1 Coates Costa Remy.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Coates playing for Sunderland against Chelsea in May 2015]]
On 1 September 2014, Coates was loaned out to fellow Premier League side [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on a season-long loan, joining up with fellow Uruguayan manager [[Gus Poyet]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29012722|title=Transfer deadline day: Sunderland sign Liverpool's Sebastian Coates|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 September 2014|access-date=1 September 2014}}</ref> He made his debut as a starter on the 23rd in the third round of the League Cup, against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] at the [[Stadium of Light]].

After the manager was sacked and replaced by [[Dick Advocaat]], Coates became more involved. He played every minute of Sunderland's run of five unbeaten games that kept them from relegation with a game to spare.

On 1 July 2015, Sunderland announced that they had signed Coates on a permanent four-year deal for an undisclosed fee reported to be in the region of £2 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/33356263|title=Sebastian Coates: Sunderland sign Liverpool defender|publisher=BBC|date=1 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/2510045/sunderland-sign-sebastian-coates-from-liverpool-for-4-years|title=Sunderland sign Sebastian Coates from Liverpool on four-year deal|work=[[ESPN FC]]|date=1 July 2015}}</ref> He scored an [[own goal]] on 1 November as the team lost 6–2 away to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Magowan|first1=Alistair|title=Everton 6-2 Sunderland|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34630289|access-date=1 November 2015|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 November 2015}}</ref>

===Sporting CP===
On 28 January 2016, Coates signed for [[Sporting CP]] on loan until the end of the season, as new ''Black Cats'' manager [[Sam Allardyce]] sought to balance the books.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sunderland defender Sebastián Coates joins Sporting Lisbon on loan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2016/jan/28/sebastian-coates-loan-sunderland-sporting-lisbon|access-date=30 June 2016|work=The Guardian|date=28 January 2016}}</ref> He made his debut on 8 February in a goalless home draw with [[Rio Ave F.C.|Rio Ave]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Coates e Barcos estreiam-se nos convocados do Sporting|trans-title=Coates and Barcos debut in Sporting's selection|url=https://desporto.sapo.pt/futebol/primeira_liga/artigo/2016/02/08/coates-e-hernan-bracos-em-estreia-nos-convocados-do-sporting-para-jogo-com-rio-ave|access-date=30 June 2016|publisher=Sapo|date=8 February 2016|language=pt}}</ref> and totalled 13 matches (all starts) over the season as the [[Lisbon]]-based club came second.

On the first day of the [[2016–17 Sporting Clube de Portugal season|2016–17]] season, at home to [[C.S. Marítimo|Marítimo]], Coates scored his first goal for the ''Leões'' to open a 2–0 win by heading in [[João Mário (footballer, born January 1993)|João Mário]]'s corner kick.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Hunter|first1=James|title=Sunderland loanwatch: Sebastian Coates helps Sporting Lisbon get off to a winning start|url=http://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/sunderland-loanwatch-sebastian-coates-helps-11751450|access-date=25 September 2016|work=Chronicle Live|date=15 August 2016}}</ref>

On 31 August 2019, Coates conceded three penalties and was sent off as Sporting fell 2–3 to [[Rio Ave F.C.|Rio Ave]]. All three fouls were against Iranian forward [[Mehdi Taremi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/sporting-cp/story/3933309/sporting-defender-concedes-3-penssent-off|title=Sporting defender concedes 3 pens, sent off|publisher=ESPN|date=31 August 2019|access-date=1 September 2019}}</ref>
