Faghani has refereed important matches such as the [[2014 AFC Champions League Final]], the [[2015 AFC Asian Cup Final]], the [[2015 FIFA Club World Cup Final]], the [[Football at the 2016 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament – Knockout stage|2016 Olympic football final match]].

== Early life ==
He was born on 21 March 1978 in [[Kashmar]], a city near [[Mashhad]]. His nickname is ''Behrooz'' ({{lang|fa|بهروز}}). His father, Mohammad Faghani ({{lang|fa|محمد فغانی}}) was also a football referee. He has a younger brother named Mohammadreza, who referees in Sweden.

Faghani was part of the youth team of [[Bank Melli F.C.|Bank Melli]], and also played for Shahab Khodro, [[Etka Gorgan F.C.|Etka]], and [[Niroye Zamini F.C.|Niroye Zamini]].
