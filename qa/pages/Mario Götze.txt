'''Mario Götze'''  (born 3 June 1992) is a German professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Bundesliga]] club [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] and the [[Germany national football team|Germany national team]]. Although his favoured position is that of a [[playmaker]], Götze has also played as a [[false nine]] or as an emergency striker.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|title=Warum Götze als Stürmer unter Favre funktioniert|url=https://www.kicker.de/734976/artikel|date=29 October 2018|website=kicker.de|language=de}}</ref><ref name=":1">{{Cite news|title=Borussia Dortmund comeback kid Mario Götze ready for a Germany recall?|url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/borussia-dortmund-mario-gotze-comeback-kid-ready-for-germany-recall-2961|website=Bundesliga|access-date=13 May 2020}}</ref>

In April 2013, a €37 million bid from Bayern Munich triggered a release clause in Götze's contract, making him the second-[[Transfer (football)#Highest fees|most expensive]] German player at the time, behind [[Mesut Özil]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/22261981|title=Mario Gotze to join Bayern Munich from Borussia Dortmund|date=23 April 2013|access-date=22 June 2013|publisher=BBC}}</ref> He spent three seasons with the club where he won a further three league titles, two DFB-Pokal trophies and a winners' medal in each of the [[FIFA Club World Cup]] and [[UEFA Super Cup]].

Götze was first selected for the Germany national football team in 2010, at the age of 18.

=== Euro 2016, hiatus and 2022 World Cup ===

Götze featured at [[UEFA Euro 2016]], appearing in four matches of Germany's semifinalists campaign. Having started every group game, he played just over 20 minutes in the knockout phase. Pundits widely criticised his performances for being nondescript.<ref>{{Cite web | author = ESPN staff | url = https://www.espn.co.uk/football/european-championship/story/2897630/germanys-mario-gotze-shrugs-off-pundit-criticism-after-struggles-at-euro-2016 | title = Germany's Mario Gotze shrugs off pundit criticism after Euro struggles | date = 19 June 2016 | publisher = ESPN | access-date= 2 January 2020}}</ref> During this time, Götze also took part in a collaboration between the [[German Football Association]] and [[The LEGO Group]], who in May 2016 released a Europe-exclusive [[Lego Minifigures (theme)|collectible minifigure series]], with Götze featured as the fifteenth of sixteen [[minifigure]]s in the collection.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.lego.com/en-my/aboutus/news/2019/november/new-lego-dfb-minifigure-series |title= This squad will be playing for the LEGO Minifigure Series "DFB – Die Mannschaft" |author=Lego Group |date= 12 April 2016 |website= Lego.com |publisher= Lego |access-date= 28 March 2022}}</ref>

In the lead up to the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], he played in a friendly against France in November 2017 after a one-year absence from the national team, but ultimately did not make the squad for the final tournament.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44123460 | title = Mario Gotze misses out on Germany's provisional squad | date = 15 May 2018 | website = BBC Sport | access-date= 15 May 2018}}</ref>

On 10 November 2022, Götze was named in Germany's [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] squad by Manager [[Hansi Flick]]. The selection was met with surprise, as it marked his return to the national side after five years.<ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63582352 | title = World Cup 2022: Midfielder Mario Gotze returns to Germany squad for first time in five years | date = 10 November 2022 | website = BBC Sport | access-date= 10 November 2022}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url = https://www.sportingnews.com/in/soccer/news/germany-world-cup-squad-2022-players-national-team-roster-26/jsyrvzcclc8z7wy39bkjowwk | title = Germany World Cup squad 2022: Mario Gotze makes surprise return to join final 26-man Germany national football team roster in Qatar | date = 10 November 2022 | website = Sporting News | access-date= 10 November 2022}}</ref>

== Style of play ==

Götze is capable of playing as either a left or right [[Forward (association football)#Winger|winger]], [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] and also as a "[[Forward (association football)#False 9|false 9]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://int.soccerway.com/news/2013/March/23/gotze-pleased-with-false-nine-spot/|title=Gotze pleased with false nine spot|date=23 March 2013|access-date= 26 August 2014 |work=Soccerway}}</ref> Götze was considered to be one of the best young players in the world, possessing speed, technique, [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] skills and [[Playmaker|playmaking]] capabilities. In his first stint at Dortmund, under manager Jürgen Klopp, Götze often played different roles in the team's 4–2–3–1 formation. Following the departure of fellow playmaker [[Shinji Kagawa]] in 2012, during the 2012–13 season, Klopp assigned Götze as central attacking midfielder. For Germany, Götze's talent has been used by German coach [[Joachim Löw]] in the "false 9" role. In more recent seasons with Dortmund, coach [[Lucien Favre]] has also used Götze in this role.<ref name=":0" /><ref name=":1" />

In 2010, the German Football Association's then-Technical Director Matthias Sammer described Götze as "one of the best talents Germany has ever had."<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.goal.com/en/news/15/germany/2010/08/13/2069066/matthias-sammer-praises-borussia-dortmunds-german-wunderkind. | title = Matthias Sammer Praises Borussia Dortmund's German Wunderkind Mario Goetze | publisher = goal.com | date = 13 August 2010 | access-date = 26 August 2014}}</ref> One year later, German football legend Franz Beckenbauer described Götze as "German Messi" for his speed and style of play.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/148/839/5/index.html | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140826114354/http://www.fifa.com/world-match-centre/news/newsid/148/839/5/index.html | url-status = dead | archive-date = 26 August 2014 | title = Beckenbauer: Gotze is Germany's Messi | publisher = FIFA | date = 7 August 2011 | access-date = 26 August 2014}}</ref> However, Götze's pace deteriorated before the peak age of an average professional footballer, and this was seen as one of the reasons for his second departure from Borussia Dortmund.<ref>{{cite web|first=Blaise |last=Bourgeois |title=Lothar Matthäus says Mario Götze is too slow for the Bundesliga |url=https://onefootball.com/en/news/lothar-matthaus-says-mario-gotze-is-too-slow-for-the-bundesliga-29806265 |date=29 April 2020 |work=OneFootball |access-date=20 July 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Tito |last=Kohout |title=Report: Fiorentina interested in Mario Götze |url=https://www.violanation.com/fiorentina-transfer-rumors-news-reports/2020/7/19/21330030/fiorentina-mario-gotze-transfer-rumor-bosman-free-agent-transfer-sign-sevilla-monaco |date=19 July 2020 |work=Viola Nation |access-date=20 July 2020 |quote=While [Götze] doesn’t have much pace left, he’s devastating with the ball at his feet and still has the technique and vision that made him one of the world’s best attackers in his prime.}}</ref>

=== Health problems ===

In early March 2017, it was reported that Götze had been suffering from a metabolic disorder.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://sports.ndtv.com/football/borussia-dortmunds-mario-goetze-indefinitely-sidelined-from-football-1664463|title=Borussia Dortmund's Mario Goetze Sidelined From Football Indefinitely | website = NDTVSports.com | date = 28 February 2017 | access-date = 3 March 2017 | first = Bhargab | last = Sarmah}}</ref> The health condition was later found out to be [[myopathy]], a muscular disorder which affects the fibres in the muscles, meaning they do not function correctly.

Speaking about discovering the health condition Götze released a statement via the Borussia Dortmund official website which read, "I'm currently undergoing treatment and will do everything in my power to be back in training and helping my team to achieve our common goals as soon as possible".<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bvb.de/eng/News/Overview/Mario-Goetze-remains-sidelined-metabolic-disturbances-diagnosed|title=Mario Götze remains sidelined, metabolic disturbances diagnosed | website= bvb.de | date = 27 February 2017 | access-date=3 March 2017}}</ref>
