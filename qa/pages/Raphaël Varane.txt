==Club career==
===Early career===
Varane was born in the city of [[Lille]] in the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] [[Regions of France|region]]. He is of [[Demographics of Martinique|Martiniquais]] heritage through his father, Gaston, who is originally from [[Le Morne-Rouge]], while his mother, Annie, was raised in [[Saint-Amand-les-Eaux]].<ref name="varane_antilles">{{cite web |url=http://www.antilles-foot.com/2011/01/29/raphael-varane-volontaire-et-determine/ |publisher=Antilles-foot |title=Raphael Varane: Volontaire et déterminé. |language=fr |date=29 January 2011 |access-date=23 May 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20110912131656/http://www.antilles-foot.com/2011/01/29/raphael-varane-volontaire-et-determine/ |archive-date=12 September 2011}}</ref> Varane began his football career in the [[Arrondissement of Lille]] playing for local club AS Hellemmes at the age of seven.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nordeclair.fr/Locales/Lille/2010/05/03/l-ash-en-tournoi-international.shtml |publisher=Nord Eclair |title=L'ASH en tournoi international |language=fr |date=3 May 2010 |access-date=14 January 2011 |archive-date=27 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727113247/http://www.nordeclair.fr/Locales/Lille/2010/05/03/l-ash-en-tournoi-international.shtml |url-status=dead}}</ref> After spending two years at the club, in July 2002, he joined professional club [[RC Lens]], despite some interest from [[Derby du Nord]] rivals and hometown club [[Lille OSC]].<ref name="varane_career">{{cite web |url=http://www.lensois.com/article-1910-varane-j-ai-grandi-au-rc-lens-.html |publisher=Lensois |title=Varane: "J'ai grandi au RC Lens" |language=fr |date=10 March 2010 |access-date=14 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100819091137/http://www.lensois.com/article-1910-varane-j-ai-grandi-au-rc-lens-.html |archive-date=19 August 2010}}</ref> Similar to the development of the club's previous prized assets such as [[Gaël Kakuta]] and [[Timothée Kolodziejczak]], Varane spent time at the Centre de Préformation de Football in nearby [[Liévin]], a training centre exclusively for players brought up in the Nord-Pas-de-Calais region.<ref name="varane_antilles"/> He spent two years at the centre training there during the weekdays and playing with Lens on the weekends.{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

After returning full-time to Lens, Varane quickly ascended up the club's youth ranks. In the 2008–09 season, alongside teammates [[Thorgan Hazard]] and [[Geoffrey Kondogbia]], he played on the club's under-16 team that won the ''Championnat National des 16 ans''. In the following season, Varane was promoted to the club's under-19 team, despite being two years younger than several of his teammates. Ahead of the [[2010–11 in French football|2010–11 season]], Varane signed his first professional contract.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.rclensois.fr/contrats/varane-et-deligny-egalement-pros-a7655.html |publisher=RC Lensois |title=Varane et Deligny également pros? |language=fr |date=16 April 2010 |access-date=14 January 2011}}</ref> He was, subsequently, promoted to the club's reserve team in the [[Championnat de France amateur]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lensois.com/breve-34965-Ab%C3%A9c%C3%A9daire%3A%20V%20comme%20Rapha%C3%ABl%20Varane.html |publisher=Lensois |title=Abécédaire: V comme Raphaël Varane |language=fr |date=1 January 2011 |access-date=14 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105062246/http://www.lensois.com/breve-34965-Ab%C3%A9c%C3%A9daire:%20V%20comme%20Rapha%C3%ABl%20Varane.html |archive-date=5 January 2011}}</ref> Varane made his amateur debut in the club's opening league match of the campaign in a 2–0 victory over [[JA Drancy|Drancy]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.foot-national.com/fiche-match-football-19483.html |publisher=Foot-National |title=Lens v.

===Lens===
In late October of the campaign, Varane was called up to the senior team by manager [[Jean-Guy Wallemme]] to train ahead of the club's match against [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]] on 6 November. He trained with the team for the entire week and, due to an injury to [[centre-back]] [[Alaeddine Yahia]], Varane was, surprisingly, named to the starting lineup.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lavoixdessports.com/L-info-Sports-en-continu/Region/2010/11/06/article_football-rc-lens-raphael-varane-devrait-debuter.shtml |publisher=La Voix des Sports |title=Raphaël Varane débutera face à Montpellier dimanche |language=fr |date=6 November 2010 |access-date=14 January 2011}}</ref> In the match, he played the full 90 minutes in a 2–0 victory.<ref name="varane_debut"/> The victory was only the club's third [[clean sheet]] of the season. Varane was praised by teammates, most notably [[Captain (association football)|captain]] [[Adil Hermach]], defensive partner [[Éric Chelle]], and [[Striker (association football)|striker]] [[David Pollet]], as well as by the local media and coach Wallemme.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nordeclair.fr/Sports/Football/2010/11/09/lens-emporte-par-le-souffle-de-la-jeunes.shtml |publisher=Nord Eclair |title=Lens emporté par le souffle de la jeunesse |language=fr |date=9 November 2010 |access-date=14 January 2011 |archive-date=27 July 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727113308/http://www.nordeclair.fr/Sports/Football/2010/11/09/lens-emporte-par-le-souffle-de-la-jeunes.shtml |url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lensois.com/breve-rclens-33699--j-ai-ete-surpris-par-rapha%C3%ABl-varane-.html |publisher=Lensois |title=J'ai été surpris par Raphaël Varane |language=fr |date=19 November 2010 |access-date=14 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101231043704/http://www.lensois.com/breve-rclens-33699--j-ai-ete-surpris-par-rapha%C3%ABl-varane-.html |archive-date=31 December 2010}}</ref> In the next two matches, Varane, alongside several other youth players, sat on the bench as Lens faced two tough teams in [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] and [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/53751 |publisher=[[Ligue de Football Professionnel]] |title=Marseille v.

In December, with both Chelle and Yahia returning to action, Varane was placed in the defensive midfielder role in the team's match against [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]]. In the match, he acted as a roving third centre-back and made a blocked save in the 84th minute on a close range shot by [[Yoan Gouffran]] to preserve a 2–1 lead.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/match_commentary/0,19764,11065_3280760,00.html |publisher=[[Sky Sports]] |title=Match Commentary: Bordeaux v.

After failing to appear in Real Madrid's first four league matches, he made his season debut on 18 September in the club's opening UEFA Champions League group stage match against English club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]]. Varane started and played the entire match as Real Madrid won 3–2.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2013/matches/round=2000347/match=2009503/index.html |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |title=Ronaldo completes remarkable Madrid comeback |date=18 September 2012 |access-date=19 September 2012}}</ref>

On 30 January 2013, Varane made his ''[[El Clásico]]'' debut against [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the [[2012–13 Copa del Rey]]. He stopped a group of dangerous attempts from Barcelona, including a shot from [[Xavi]] that he cleared from the goal line. He capped his performance with a headed goal in the game, which ended 1–1. He also became the second-youngest foreign player to score for Real Madrid in a Clásico match. In the return leg at the [[Camp Nou]] on 26 February 2013, Varane scored Madrid's third goal in a 3–1 away win with a header from a corner kick by Mesut Özil. Varane gained praise from former World Cup winner [[Bixente Lizarazu]] after his performances against Barcelona and [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]]. He said, "We are talking about a kid at Real Madrid who has unseated [[Pepe (footballer born 1983)|Pepe]], and Pepe, with all his stuff, is still a great centre-half. His performance against Manchester United and Barcelona was extraordinary". Varane continued to impress in the [[2012–13 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] quarter final first leg against [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]], where he helped Madrid keep a clean sheet in a 3–0 triumph. All of his 27 passes found his teammates without any interception, and all of his tackles succeeded, with most on [[Didier Drogba]].{{citation needed|date=June 2021}}

On 2 February 2023, Varane announced his retirement from international football via his [[Instagram]] account. The defender shared a series of photos from his international career alongside the announcement.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Raphael Varane on Instagram: "Représenter notre magnifique pays pendant une décennie a été l'un des plus grands honneurs de ma vie. A chaque fois que j'ai porté ce maillot bleu si spécial, j'ai ressenti une immense fierté. Le devoir de tout donner, de jouer avec mon cœur et de gagner à chaque fois qu'on entrait sur le terrain. Cela fait plusieurs mois que j'y réfléchis et j'ai décidé que c'était le bon moment pour moi de prendre ma retraite internationale. Enfant, je me rappelle avoir suivi France 98, cette équipe, ces joueurs qui nous ont fait vivre des émotions indescriptibles. Je rêvais de faire comme nos héros et, 20 ans après, j'ai vécu l'une des plus belles expériences de ma vie, de celles qui m'ont rendu vraiment fier. On a ramené la Coupe à la maison !! Je ne l'oublierai jamais. Je ressens toujours chacune des émotions ressenties ce jour-là, le 15 juillet 2018. Ça a été l'un des moments les plus formidables et les plus mémorables de ma vie. Cette victoire que nous avons remportée tous ensemble n'aurait jamais été possible sans le soutien de Didier Deschamps, de chacun des membres de l'encadrement et de notre staff durant ces années, de mes coéquipiers qui ont défendu notre maillot à chacun de nos matchs. Mais plus important encore, cette victoire n'aurait pas été possible sans le soutien de chacun d'entre vous tout au long de ce chemin. Votre ferveur, les célébrations et les souvenirs de notre retour en France resteront gravés à jamais en moi. Même après la défaite en finale l'année dernière, avec certes un beau parcours, vous nous avez accueillis en héros à notre retour. A chacune et à chacun de vous, mille fois MERCI ! Ces moments avec vous me manqueront c'est certain, mais le moment est venu pour la nouvelle génération de prendre le relais. Nous avons un groupe de jeunes joueurs talentueux qui est prêt à prendre la relève, qui mérite d'avoir sa chance et qui a besoin de vous. Du plus profond de mon cœur, merci. Rapha. 💙🤍♥️" |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/CoKMpXSOZtt/ |access-date=2023-02-02 |website=Instagram |language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=France's Varane retires from international football |language=en-GB |work=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64498739 |access-date=2023-02-02}}</ref> The announcement marked the end of his 10 year run with the national team where he made 93 appearances and scored 5 goals.

==Style of play==
Varane has been described by Lens youth coach [[Éric Assadourian]] as a "truly first-class player" who is "comfortable on both the tactical and technical level".<ref name="lensois">{{cite web |url=http://www.lensois.com/article-1909-qui-sont-varane-kondogbia-hazard-et-deligny.html |publisher=Lensois |title=Qui sont Varane, Kondogbia, Hazard et Deligny |language=fr |date=9 March 2010 |access-date=14 January 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713201142/http://www.lensois.com/article-1909-qui-sont-varane-kondogbia-hazard-et-deligny.html |archive-date=13 July 2011}}</ref> On 30 January 2013, the then Real Madrid assistant coach [[Aitor Karanka]] talked about Varane in the press conference post-''[[El Clásico]]'' of the [[Copa del Rey]], saying, "It's obvious that Varane has a good head on his shoulders and will keep improving."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.insidespanishfootball.com/41828/karanka-the-team-did-an-amazing-job/ |title=Karanka: The team did an amazing job and really were good|access-date=30 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160322010738/http://www.insidespanishfootball.com/41828/karanka-the-team-did-an-amazing-job/|archive-date=22 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Former France defender [[Frank Leboeuf]] believes that Varane has the potential to be better than Real Madrid legend [[Fernando Hierro]], saying to reporters, "Many compare him to Hierro due to his technique, but on the physical level he is stronger and he is much faster."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/3277/la-liga/2013/03/27/3857599/lebouef-varane-could-surpass-hierro |title=Lebouef: Varane could surpass Hierro|access-date=27 February 2013}}</ref> Fernando Hierro and [[José Mourinho]] have labelled Varane as one of the best defenders in world football.<ref name="goal1">{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/3277/la-liga/2014/03/06/4665852/varane-best-defender-in-the-world-says-mourinho |title=Varane best defender in the world, says Mourinho |website=goal.com}}</ref><ref name="goal2">{{cite web |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/12/spanish-football/2013/10/17/4339741/hierro-varane-is-the-worlds-best-defender |title=Hierro: Varane is the world's best defender |website=goal.com}}</ref>
