Born in [[Zaire]], Mandanda played for the [[France national football team|France national team]]. Making his debut in 2008, he represented France at seven international tournaments: four [[UEFA European Championship]]s ([[UEFA Euro 2008|2008]], [[UEFA Euro 2012|2012]], [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016]] and [[UEFA Euro 2020|2020]]) and three [[FIFA World Cup]]s ([[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]], [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022]]), winning the tournament in 2018.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Mandanda was born on 28 March 1985 in [[Kinshasa]], Democratic Republic of the Congo (then [[Zaire]]), but he moved with his family to [[Évreux]], France when he was two years old. He practiced [[boxing]] before joining the local team ALM Évreux at age nine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stevemandanda.net/fr/biographie/enfance.asp%23section1|archive-url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20121107182752/http://stevemandanda.net/fr/biographie/enfance.asp%23section1|url-status=dead|archive-date=7 November 2012|title=Biographie de Steve Mandanda|work=stevemandanda.net|language=fr}}</ref>

===Le Havre===
Mandanda made his league debut for Le Havre in August 2005, and did not concede a goal until his fourth match. He played 30 league matches in the 2005–06 season and 37 in 2006–07, with his performances attracting the attention of other clubs. Following an unsuccessful trial at [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] prior to the 2007–08 season,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fansfc.com/astonvillafootballclub/news.asp?newsid=169629 |title=France goalkeeper in Aston Villa trial |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522110650/http://www.fansfc.com/astonvillafootballclub/news.asp?newsid=169629 |archive-date=22 May 2011 }}</ref> he joined Marseille in summer 2007.

===Marseille===
[[File:Steve Mandanda 5312.jpg|thumb|left|Mandanda with Marseille in 2010]]

At the start of his first season with Marseille, Mandanda was regarded as an understudy to first choice keeper [[Cédric Carrasso]]. However a knee injury ruled Carrasso out for six months, leaving the way clear for Mandanda to become a regular fixture in Ligue 1, Champions League and UEFA Cup matches. On 5 March 2008, Mandanda joined Marseille on a permanent four-year contract.

At the end of Mandanda's final season at Marseille he was named as the club's Player of the Season. It was the second time that he won the award having previously done so in the 2007-08 campaign.<ref name=Olympian>{{cite news|last=Daurès|first=Camille|date=1 June 2016|url=https://www.om.net/en/news/252336/mandanda-olympian-2015-16-season|title=Mandanda, Olympian of the 2015-16 season|publisher=Olympique de Marseille|access-date=23 July 2016}}</ref>

On 1 July 2016, [[Premier League]] club [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] announced that they had completed the signing of Mandanda on a free transfer from Marseille.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cpfc.co.uk/news/2016/july/mandanda-pens-crystal-palace-deal/|title=Mandanda Pens Crystal Palace Deal|website=Crystal Palace Football Club|date=1 July 2016|access-date=1 July 2016 }}</ref> He struggled to make an impact, being injured for most of the season.
