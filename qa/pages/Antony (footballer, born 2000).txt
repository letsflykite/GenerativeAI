'''Antony Matheus dos Santos''' (born 24 February 2000), simply known as '''Antony''', is a Brazilian professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[winger (association football)|winger]] for {{English football updater|ManchesU}} club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] and the [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national team]].

Antony graduated from the [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]] academy and made his senior debut for the club in 2018. He moved abroad to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in the summer of 2020, where he won two [[Eredivisie]] titles and one [[KNVB Cup]] during his two seasons. Antony's performances in the Netherlands led to a transfer worth [[Euro|€]]95&nbsp;million ([[Pound sterling|£]]82&nbsp;million) to Manchester United, the highest sum paid for an Eredivisie player.

Antony won a gold medal with the [[Brazil national under-23 football team|Brazil under-23]] team at the [[Football at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2020 Summer Olympics]]. He then made his senior international debut and scored against [[Venezuela national football team|Venezuela]] in October 2021, going on to represent Brazil at the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]].

==Early life==
Antony was born in [[Osasco]], [[São Paulo]], Brazil, and grew up in Inferninho, a [[favela]] far from the city centre. Growing up, he would play football wherever he could on the streets or in his house, combining his love of [[futsal]] with [[street football]] and regularly attending [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]] matches with his aunt.<ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es_STE_R94c&t=3s|title=The Rise Of Antony - From 3-Time Reject to 100,000,000$ Player|author=Daily Dose of Football|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=21 September 2022}}</ref> He is of Portuguese descent.<ref>{{cite video|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRJ8C_BIh2U|title=7 Things You Didn't Know About Antony, Man United's Newest Star|author=Oh My Goal|publisher=[[YouTube]]|access-date=21 September 2022}}</ref>

==Club career==
===São Paulo===
====Youth====
He began playing football at an early age, and he was soon spotted by São Paulo, who offered him a contract in 2010, aged 10, where he was inducted into their youth academy.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Antony is inspired by Lucas, remembers Choque-Rei from 2010 and dreams of repeating it|url=https://www.terra.com.br/esportes/lance/antony-se-inspira-in-lucas-remembers-shock-king-of-2010-and-dreams-repeat,dfbfd044d639a1eab83a6daec883371fzqfirmy4.html|language=PT-BR}}</ref> During his youth years, Antony struggled for game time and was close to being dismissed from the club's youth ranks, but the staff convinced his manager to keep him. While in the youth academy, Antony met [[Helinho (footballer, born 2000)|Helinho]] and [[Igor Gomes]], becoming good friends in the process. In September 2018, Antony helped his team win the J-League Challenge tournament in Japan, being named the tournament's best player.<ref name="MOT">{{cite web|url=http://www.saopaulofc.net/noticias/noticias/futebol-de-base/2018/9/17/sub-17-e-campeao-da-j-league-challenge-cup|title=U-17 is champion of the J League Challenge Cup|date=17 September 2018|publisher=[[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]]|author=Ana Luiza Rosa}}</ref>

====2019–20: Campeonato Paulista success and final seasons====
Following his impressive displays in the tournament, Antony returned to the first team, and with São Paulo struggling in the [[Campeonato Paulista]], he began receiving more first-team minutes.

====2021–22: Breakthrough and second Eredivisie title====
The following season, despite the signings of [[Mohamed Daramy]] and [[Steven Berghuis]], Antony kept his place in the starting line-up, and with his two goals and five assists against [[Sporting CP]] and [[Borussia Dortmund]], Ajax became the first Dutch club to [[2021–22 UEFA Champions League group stage#Group C|win all six Champions League group games]] in the competition's history.<ref>{{cite news |title=Sporting Lisbon 1&ndash;5 Ajax |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/58577414 |access-date=19 July 2022 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=15 September 2021}}</ref> His three goals and one assist earned him the league's Player of the Month and Talent of the Month award for December.<ref name="PTM"/> On 20 March, Antony scored a dramatic late winner in a 3–2 victory against [[De Klassieker]] rivals [[Feyenoord]] in Eredivisie, being five minutes into the added time, before being sent off, after receiving a second yellow card seconds later for time wasting.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tribuna.com/en/news/football-2022-03-22-ajax-star-antony-gets-sent-off-for-time-wasting-after-being-grabbed-by-dusan-tadic/|title=Throwback to when Antony got sent off for time wasting after being grabbed by Dusan Tadic|date=22 March 2022|website=tribuna.com}}</ref>

Nine days later, while on international duty for [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national team]], during a [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONMEBOL)|World Cup qualification]] match, Antony suffered an ankle injury, which ruled him out for the remainder of the season.
