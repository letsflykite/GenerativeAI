From the age of six, Lazović began to train in the youth academy of [[FK Borac Čačak]]. By the time he played for the junior team, he was attracting the attention of scouts from outside of [[Čačak]]. On 2 March 2008, he made his senior debut for Borac head coach [[Milovan Rajevac]] in a league match against [[FK Hajduk Kula|Hajduk Kula]]. He scored his first competitive goal for Borac Čačak on 22 March 2008, in a [[Serbian Superliga]] match against [[FK Vojvodina|Vojvodina]].
