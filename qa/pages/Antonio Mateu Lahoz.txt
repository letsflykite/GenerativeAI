'''Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz''' ({{IPA-es|anˈtonjo miˈɣel maˈtew laˈoθ}}; born 12 March 1977) is a Spanish retired [[Referee (association football)|association football referee]] who refereed [[La Liga]] matches from 2008 until 2023. He is also a former [[FIFA International Referees List|international referee]] with experience in several editions of the [[FIFA World Cup]]. He is known for his talkative and "[[Eccentricity (behavior)|quirky]]" approach to refereeing:<ref name=":3">{{cite web |last1=McTear |first1=Euan |title=Mateu Lahoz, Spain's "quirky" referee |url=https://www.tifofootball.com/features/mateu-lahoz-spains-quirky-referee/ |website=Tifo Football |access-date=10 October 2019 |language=en |date=5 March 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315200312/https://www.tifofootball.com/features/mateu-lahoz-spains-quirky-referee/ |archivedate=15 March 2018 |url-status=dead}}</ref> ''[[The Guardian]]'' has described him as the football star "who doesn't actually play but doesn't half perform".<ref name=":4">{{Cite web |date=2023-01-02 |title=Antonio Mateu Lahoz plays his cards wrong to make history in Catalan derby {{!}} Sid Lowe |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2023/jan/02/antonio-mateu-lahoz-plays-cards-wrong-catalan-derby-referee-barcelona-espanyol-la-liga |access-date=2023-01-22 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref>

==Early and personal life==
Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz was born on 12 March 1977<ref name=":6">{{Cite web |date=2016 |title=Antonio Mateu |url=https://www.olympedia.org/athletes/5001273 |access-date=2023-01-24 |website=[[Olympedia]]}}</ref> in [[Algímia d'Alfara]], a village in [[Province of Valencia|Valencia Province]] on Spain's eastern coast. He has a large family, with two brothers and three sisters. His elder brother, mother and late father influenced his decision to take up refereeing;<ref name="K" /> in part, the family's need for money after his father passing young prompted him to move into refereeing full-time rather than becoming a footballer. He played in the [[Segunda División B]]<ref name=":4" /> and was a [[physical education teacher]] before becoming a football referee. His elder sister also works as a teacher, and he has said he could see himself continuing in that career when he retires from refereeing.<ref name=K>{{cite web | url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/0269-1261fab78f9f-aedf39b39337-1000--refereeing-is-happiness-porto-final-referee-mateu-lahoz/ | title='Refereeing is happiness' – Porto final referee Mateu Lahoz | date=28 May 2021 }}</ref> He lives in Valencia and has two sons.<ref name=":4" />

Mateu Lahoz said that refereeing is his happiness, while reflecting on the importance of the role; he enjoyed the responsibility, telling [[UEFA]] in 2021 that "part of [the] job is trying to help the players and coaches. If you can do this and be relaxed, then you'll relax them, you can communicate together, and making decisions can be much easier."<ref name="K" /><ref name=":7">{{Cite web |last=Davies |first=Mathew |date=2022-06-05 |title=Wales v Ukraine ref once booked four players in seconds and sent Guardiola off |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/wales-ukraine-referee-mateu-lahoz-24142852 |access-date=2023-01-24 |website=WalesOnline |language=en}}</ref>

== Career ==
===Spain===
[[File:Antonio Miguel Mateu Lahoz 4505.jpg|thumb|upright|Mateu Lahoz in 2010]]
In 2008, Mateu Lahoz began working as a referee in [[La Liga]], becoming established as one of the most prominent referees in Spain during his career.<ref name=":1" /> Considered unpopular among Spanish football fans, Mateu Lahoz is known for his personal flair; it was reported that he would allow matches to descend into chaos by not reacting to play, and then draw more attention to himself than the game through bizarre discussions with players and controversial decisions.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web |date=2022-10-08 |title=El Real Madrid se salvó de Mateu Lahoz con el Clásico en el horizonte |url=https://www.defensacentral.com/real_madrid/1665253926-el-real-madrid-se-salvo-de-mateu-lahoz-pensando-en-el-clasico-de-la-proxima-semana |access-date=2023-01-01 |website=www.defensacentral.com |language=es}}</ref>

In 2012, he refereed in the [[Supercopa de España]].<ref name=":1">{{Cite web |title=Cup final |url=http://www.marca.com/eventos/marcador/futbol/2013_14/copa/final/bar_rma/ |website=Maraca}}</ref> It was around this time that he first became known for a particular style, as it was commented on by then-[[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] manager [[José Mourinho]]; this response was praise, with Mourinho finding it a pleasant difference that Mateu Lahoz preferred talking to players over immediately disciplining them, and that what he did kept the game moving.<ref name=":4" /> [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] manager [[Xavi]] also said, years later, that he found Mateu Lahoz talking a lot to be positive when he was a player (for Barcelona) around that time; the Barcelona manager of the time, [[Pep Guardiola]], reportedly "wasn't such a fan".<ref name=":14">{{Cite web |last=Corrigan |first=Dermot |title=Barcelona vs Espanyol or The Mateu Lahoz Show? |url=https://theathletic.com/4047692/2023/01/01/mateu-lahoz-referee-barcelona-espanyol/ |access-date=2023-01-24 |website=The Athletic |language=en}}</ref>

Mateu Lahoz was the referee in [[2014 Copa del Rey Final]] between Real Madrid and [[El Clásico|main rivals]] Barcelona.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Copa final Bar against RM |url=http://www.marca.com/eventos/marcador/futbol/2013_14/copa/final/bar_rma/ |website=Maraca}}</ref> In May 2014, he stood out for booking Barcelona's [[Lionel Messi]] for dissent when Messi protested an offside call; shown to be onside, Mateu Lahoz supposedly apologised for the mistake after the game.<ref name=":14" /> After a 2018 match in which a number of Mateu Lahoz' reportedly questionable decisions went against Barcelona, player [[Gerard Piqué]] had to be physically restrained when approaching him after the match.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2018-03-01 |title=LaLiga - Las Palmas 1-1 Barcelona: Pique had to be restrained when arguing with referee Mateu Lahoz |url=https://www.marca.com/en/football/barcelona/2018/03/02/5a9885e046163fbc298b45fd.html |access-date=2023-02-19 |website=MARCA in English |language=en}}</ref> In 2019, Mateu Lahoz had another notable run-in with Barcelona, showing two [[Red card (association football)|red cards]] in a minute: the first to [[Ronald Araújo]] for a reportedly debatable [[professional foul]], the second a straight red to [[Ousmane Dembélé]] for supposedly protesting that decision. The severity of the second card was criticised, as was the application of a card at all, with Messi noting that Dembélé did not speak Spanish and questioning how he would have been able to dissent.<ref name=":14" />

A clip of Mateu Lahoz went [[Viral video|viral]] on 2 April 2022; he was in charge a La Liga match between [[RCD Mallorca]] and [[Getafe CF|Getafe]] when he gave four [[Penalty card|yellow cards]] in a single second. Having let a row break out between the teams, he brought two players from each side over to him before showing his card to each of them in an arc. Not seen in the clip, Mateu Lahoz then ran over to a fifth player to card him.<ref name=":8">{{Cite web |date=2022-04-02 |title=La Liga’s Mateu Lahoz takes refereeing to new heights after booking four players in a second |url=https://www.givemesport.com/87991404-mateu-lahoz-la-liga-referee-books-four-players-at-once-in-getafe-v-mallorca |access-date=2023-01-24 |website=GiveMeSport |language=en-GB}}</ref> More controversially, Mateu Lahoz awarded a penalty to Getafe for handball, and sent off the Mallorca defender, [[Franco Russo]]. The most notable point of the match was Mateu Lahoz approaching Getafe striker [[Enes Ünal]] in the tunnel at half-time to say Ünal "owed him one"; having shown Ünal a yellow card in the first half, spectators were surprised when Mateu Lahoz did not send off Ünal after he then elbowed Russo. Ünal and Russo were two of the four shown yellows at once. Mallorca filed formal complaints with both La Liga and the [[Royal Spanish Football Federation]] (RFEF) regarding Mateu Lahoz' decisions.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-04-03 |title=Real Mallorca to lodge complaint against Saturday's referee |url=https://www.majorcadailybulletin.com/sport/real-mallorca/2022/04/03/99543/real-mallorca-club-lodge-complaint-against-referee.html |access-date=2023-01-24 |website=Majorca Daily Bulletin |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":9">{{Cite web |date=2022-04-25 |title=Mateu descansó dos jornadas tras el Getafe-Mallorca por la frase "me debes una" |url=https://www.mundodeportivo.com/futbol/laliga/20220425/1001793116/mateu-descanso-dos-jornadas-getafe-mallorca-frase-me-debes.html |access-date=2023-01-24 |website=Mundo Deportivo |language=es}}</ref> In response, the arbitration committee sat him out for two matchdays, reported to be for what he said to Ünal.<ref name=":9" />

On 31 December 2022, Mateu Lahoz refereed the end-of-year [[Derbi barceloní|Catalan derby]] between Barcelona and local rivals [[RCD Espanyol|Espanyol]]. Mateu Lahoz was already subject to criticism at the time, following a high-profile [[FIFA World Cup]] match in which he handed out many cards. Partway through the first half, he stopped play and sprinted across the pitch to talk to and kiss Barcelona manager Xavi.<ref name=":4" /><ref name=":14" /> Mateu Lahoz gave 15 yellow cards, including 2 to the Barcelona bench, and 4 reds, one overturned by [[Video assistant referee|VAR]] (also reported as 16 yellows and 3 reds with one overturned), during the match, which became particularly chaotic towards the end. The match ended in a draw;<ref name=":4" /><ref>{{Cite web |last=Summerscales |first=Robert |title=Referee Mateu Lahoz Issues 15 Yellow Cards And Two Reds As Barcelona And Espanyol Draw |url=https://www.si.com/fannation/soccer/futbol/news/referee-mateu-lahoz-15-yellow-cards-2-reds-barcelona-vs-espanyol |access-date=2023-01-22 |website=Futbol on FanNation |language=en}}</ref><ref name=":12">{{Cite web |last=Burlaga |first=Kate |last2=Ballus |first2=Pol |date=5 January 2023 |title=Referee Mateu Lahoz left off La Liga duty this weekend |url=https://theathletic.com/4060155/2023/01/05/mateu-lahoz-la-liga/ |access-date=2023-01-24 |website=The Athletic}}</ref> Xavi told the press after the match that he did not blame Mateu Lahoz for the result, but had told him at the end of the match that he had lost control (for which he gave Xavi a yellow card).<ref name=":14" /> ''[[The Athletic]]'' wrote that while Mateu Lahoz did not get any major calls wrong during the match, "there is a feeling among players and coaches that when a situation gets heated and players start to lose their heads, he is unable to calm things down." It also questioned whether it was appropriate for the RFEF to have assigned Mateu Lahoz to the match, considering both his history (with Barcelona and then-recently in Qatar) and pre-existing tensions between the clubs meaning it would likely be very heated.<ref name=":14" /> 

Mateu Lahoz then refereed a [[Copa del Rey]] match between [[Sevilla FC|Sevilla]] and [[Linares Deportivo]] on 5 January 2023, showing a red card to Sevilla's manager after 17 minutes,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Clark |first=Gill |date=2023-01-05 |title=Mateu Lahoz in the headlines again after Barcelona disasterclass |url=https://www.barcablaugranes.com/2023/1/5/23539525/mateu-lahoz-in-the-headlines-again-after-barcelona-disasterclass |access-date=2023-01-22 |website=Barca Blaugranes}}</ref> the only card shown in this match.

===International===
From 2011 to 2023, he was also a [[FIFA]] listed international referee.<ref name=":1" /> He worked as a referee in the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2014 FIFA World Cup qualifiers]];<ref>{{cite web |title=Statistics for ANTONIO MATEU LAHOZ |url=http://worldreferee.com/site/copy.php?linkID=7388&linkType=referee&contextType=bio |access-date=1 March 2018 |work=World Referee}}</ref> at the [[2016 Summer Olympics]] in Brazil;<ref name=":6" /> the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] in Russia (and [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|its qualifiers]]);<ref>{{Cite web |title=Mateu lahoz un record mundial en un mar de criticas |url=https://as.com/futbol/mundial/mateu-lahoz-un-record-mundial-en-un-mar-de-criticas-n/ |website=AS|date=10 December 2022 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |date=23 November 2017 |title=Two PRO referees selected for 2018 FIFA World Cup |url=http://proreferees.com/2017/11/23/two-pro-referees-selected-for-2018-fifa-world-cup/ |access-date=1 March 2018 |publisher=Professional Referee Organization}}</ref> the [[UEFA Euro 2020]];<ref name="K" /> and the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] in Qatar.<ref name=":5" />

He refereed a [[2017–18 UEFA Champions League knockout phase#Quarter-finals|2018 Champions League quarter-final]] match between [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], during which Pep Guardiola, Manchester City's Spanish manager, notably addressed him on the pitch when half-time came.<ref name=":11" /> Guardiola was then sent off in the second half, for speaking to Mateu Lahoz after he disallowed a City goal; Guardiola responded that he had been polite and so getting sent off was too much, also saying that "Mateu Lahoz is a special guy, he likes to be different, he likes to be special. He's a referee who likes to feel different, he's special."<ref name=":7" /> [[The Athletic|''The Offside Rule'']] wrote that Mateu Lahoz allowed incidents between players to flare up by not paying attention to the game, and described the disallowed goal in this match as "a catastrophic error".<ref name=":11">{{Cite web |date=2018-04-14 |title=Michael Oliver spot on to award Real Madrid penalty says Mark Halsey in Ref Review |url=https://offsiderulepodcast.com/2018/04/14/michael-oliver-spot-on-to-award-real-madrid-penalty-says-mark-halsey-in-ref-review/ |access-date=2023-01-01 |website=The Offside Rule |language=en}}</ref> On 29 May 2021, Mateu Lahoz refereed the [[2021 UEFA Champions League final]] between Manchester City and [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].<ref>{{cite web |date=12 May 2021 |title=Referee teams appointed for UEFA Champions League and UEFA Europa League finals |url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/mediaservices/mediareleases/news/0269-12424b21d5b7-861f73160929-1000--mateu-lahoz-and-turpin-to-referee-finals/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/RQMNV |archive-date=1 June 2021 |access-date=12 May 2021 |publisher=UEFA}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Siddall |first=Harry |title='He's Come Out of Retirement For Us!', 'And We Thought Marriner Was Bad' – Lots of Man City Fans React to Champions League Announcement |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/manchestercity/news/hes-come-out-of-retirement-for-us-and-we-though-marriner-was-bad-lots-of-man-city-fans-react-to-champions-league-announcement |access-date=15 December 2021 |website=Sports Illustrated Manchester City News, Analysis and More |language=en}}</ref> A more natural game, he still produced a much-discussed moment when he helped [[Antonio Rüdiger]], on the ground injured, to stand up, then immediately showed him a yellow card.<ref name=":8" />

Mateu Lahoz distinguished himself from his peers in refereeing, though his quirks in arbitration have changed over time. Initially noted for being particularly talkative, which some saw as preferable to being strict and others found too lenient and distracting, his particular style reportedly became more erratic: at points he chose to converse with players at large, while at others he would directly give cards for minor infractions, including to people asking him about other cards. English journalist of Spanish football [[Sid Lowe]] coined the term "''mateulahozing''" as a verb to describe refereeing that draws attention to itself.<ref name=":4" /> The manner in which Mateu Lahoz showed players cards, "striding over and thrusting yellow cards in their faces", is said to be one source of his notoriety.<ref name=":14" /> Mateu Lahoz has been compared to English referee [[Mike Dean (referee)|Mike Dean]], also known for "producing multiple bizarre moments on the pitch."<ref name=":8" />

In Spain, Mateu Lahoz was widely accused of being a fan of Real Madrid, due to his decisions in matches featuring them or their rivals often benefitting Real Madrid; fans of the club argue that, while his decisions against other teams sometimed helped Real Madrid, he also made controversial calls that did not help them, and was an inconsistent referee in general.<ref name=":2" /> Discussions of Mateu Lahoz' calls often involve the rivalry between Real Madrid and Barcelona, further contributed to by Barcelona figures feeling he lacked match control and Real Madrid manager [[Carlo Ancelotti]] instead favouring him, saying that "Mateu Lahoz is the best referee in Spain and in Europe".<ref name=":14" /> Though considered unpopular among fans,<ref name=":2" /> there are also people who enjoyed his refereeing for its entertainment value; Lowe has pointed to this as a reason why comical hatred of Mateu Lahoz is unfair, also arguing that while he was attention-seeking, Spanish fans and media have been happy to give him that attention.<ref name=":4" />

He became an international "[[:wikt:pantomime villain|pantomime villain]]" of football in December 2022<ref name=":10">{{cite web |title=Referee Antonio Mateu Lahoz put ‘in the fridge’ for card-happy performances |url=https://onefootball.com/en/news/referee-antonio-mateu-lahoz-put-in-the-fridge-for-card-happy-performances-36533879 |access-date=2023-01-24 |website=OneFootball}}</ref> – in this month he refereed just two matches, both particularly high-profile, while handing out over 35 cards.<ref name=":4" /> From these games, he has the records for handing out the most cards in a World Cup match and the most cards in a La Liga match.<ref name=":13" />{{Efn|Reports on the matches differ in total card count, both due to the number and timing of cards making it confusing even on the referee's report, and with some sources counting two yellows converted to reds and others not.

After the first of the matches, the 2022 World Cup quarter-final between the Netherlands and Argentina, Spanish fans were reportedly grateful for Mateu Lahoz' performance;<ref name=":4" /> notorious in Spain and somewhat recognised for his previous international exploits,<ref name=":3" /> the prominent match revealed the lack of quality in Spanish refereeing in general and "everyone else finally knew what they [Spanish teams] were up against".<ref name=":4" />
