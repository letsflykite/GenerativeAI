'''Eden Michael Walter Hazard''' (born 7 January 1991) is a Belgian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Winger (association football)|winger]] or [[attacking midfielder]]. Known for his creativity, [[dribbling]], passing and vision, Hazard is considered one of the best players of his generation.<ref>{{cite web |date=6 September 2018 |title=Liverpool star says Chelsea's Eden Hazard is among top five players in the world |url=https://talksport.com/football/419702/chelsea-eden-hazard-liverpool-andy-robertson/ |publisher=Talksport |access-date=29 May 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Meade |first=Samuel |date=19 July 2021 |title=Where Ronaldo's five players he tipped to become the best in the world are now |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/ronaldo-football-future-stars-messi-24565520 |newspaper=Daily Mirror |access-date=29 May 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=5 June 2019 |title=Eden Hazard 'close' to Messi and Cristiano level, says Kepa |url=https://en.as.com/en/2019/06/05/soccer/1559740512_852740.html |newspaper=Diario AS |location=Madrid |access-date=29 May 2022}}</ref>

Hazard is the son of two former footballers and began his career in Belgium playing for local youth clubs. In 2005, he moved to France, where he began his senior career with [[Ligue 1]] club [[Lille OSC|Lille]]. Hazard spent two years in the club's academy and, at the age of 16, made his professional debut in November 2007. He became an integral part of the Lille team under manager [[Rudi Garcia]]. In his first full season, he became the first non-French player to win the [[Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year]] award, and the following season became the first player to win the award twice. In the [[2010–11 in French football|2010–11 season]], he was a part of the Lille team that won the [[Double (association football)|league and cup double]] and, as a result of his performances, was named the [[Ligue 1 Player of the Year]], the youngest player to win the award.

After making over 190 appearances and scoring 50 goals for Lille, Hazard signed for English club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in June 2012. He won the [[UEFA Europa League]] in his first season and the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]] in his second. In the [[2014–15 Chelsea F.C. season|2014–15 season]], Hazard helped Chelsea win the [[Football League Cup]] and [[Premier League]], earning him the [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] and the [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]] awards. Two years later he won his second English league title as Chelsea won the [[2016–17 Premier League|2016–17]] Premier League. In 2018, he won the [[2017–18 FA Cup|FA Cup]], and was named in the [[FIFA FIFPRO Men's World 11]]. He won the Europa League again with Chelsea in June 2019. At Chelsea, Hazard established himself as one of the best players in the world. He joined Real Madrid in the summer of 2019 in a transfer worth up to €150&nbsp;million, making it one of the [[List of most expensive association football transfers|highest transfer fees ever]]; however, injury woes and declining performances lead to him only playing a limited number of games, departing the club in 2023.

Having represented his country at various [[Belgium national youth football team|youth levels]], Hazard made his senior debut for the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]] in November 2008, aged 17, in a [[Friendly (association football)|friendly]] against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]]. Nearly three years after his debut, Hazard scored his first international goal against [[Kazakhstan national football team|Kazakhstan]] in October 2011. He has since earned over 126 caps, and was a member of the Belgian squad which reached the quarter-finals of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 2016]], and [[UEFA Euro 2020|Euro 2020]]. At the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018 World Cup]], he [[Captain (association football)|captained]] Belgium to third place which was their best finish in history, receiving the [[FIFA World Cup Silver Ball|Silver Ball]] as the second-best player of the tournament. From 2015 to 2022, he served as the captain of the team, including the time Belgium topped the FIFA men's ranking for the first time, which became the longest continuous reign of any European team.

==Early life==
Hazard was born in [[La Louvière]] and grew up in [[Braine-le-Comte]]. His mother Carine, and father Thierry, were both footballers. His father spent most of his career at semi-professional level with [[R.A.A.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Hazard began his football career playing for his hometown club [[Royal Stade Brainois]] at the age of four. During his time at the club, one of his youth coaches described him as a "gifted" player. He added: "He knew everything. I had nothing to teach him".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nordeclair.fr/Sports/Football/2011/11/15/a-braine-le-comte-sur-les-traces-d-eden.shtml |title=À Braine-le-Comte, sur les traces d'Eden Hazard |date=15 November 2011 |access-date=29 November 2011 |newspaper=Nord éclair |location=Roubaix |language=fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422040603/http://www.nordeclair.fr/Sports/Football/2011/11/15/a-braine-le-comte-sur-les-traces-d-eden.shtml |archive-date=22 April 2012}}</ref> Hazard spent eight years at the club before moving to AFC Tubize. While at Tubize, he was spotted by a [[Lille OSC|Lille]] scout while playing in a local tournament with the club. The scout's subsequent report on the player prompted club officials to meet with Hazard's father and offer the young player an ''aspirant'' (youth) contract.<ref name="eden_contract">{{cite news |title=8 nouveaux professionnels au LOSC |url=http://www.losc.fr/?r=0,0,14,20 |publisher=Lille OSC |access-date=10 April 2010 |language=fr}}</ref>

Hazard's parents accepted the offer from Lille head of academy [[Jean-Michel Vandamme]] with hopes that the training facilities in France would be better.<ref name="eden_hazard2"/> Hazard's father later admitted that the decision to let Eden and, later Thorgan, join clubs in the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais|North of France]] was the best solution stating "They remained so close to home and, at the same time, they integrated at structures where they could grow, because in Belgium, unfortunately, it's a little empty for the training of youth".<ref name="eden_family"/>

===Lille===
====Early Lille career====
Hazard joined Lille in 2005 and spent two years developing in the club's local sports school, due to its youth academy in Luchin not being in operation at that time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/video/videoid=1683656.html?autoplay=true |title=Lille's Hazard looks back and forward to Trabzonspor |date=27 September 2011|access-date=27 September 2011 |publisher=UEFA}}</ref> On 28 May 2007, he signed his first professional contract agreeing to a three-year deal with Lille.<ref name="eden_contract"/> At the start of the [[2007–08 Lille OSC season|2007–08 season]], at the age of 16, Hazard was promoted to [[Lille OSC II|the club's reserve team]] in the [[Championnat de France Amateur]], the fourth level of French football, though he still played with Lille's under-18 team in its league and the [[Coupe Gambardella]].

After spending the majority of October and the early part of November playing with the club's under-18 team, on 14 November, due to several players being on international duty, Hazard was called up to the senior team by manager [[Claude Puel]] to participate in a [[Friendly (association football)|friendly]] against Belgian club [[Club Brugge KV|Club Brugge]] on 16 November.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://losc.fr/?r=0,0,14,1684 |title=Formation: carton plein des 18 ans Nationaux! |publisher=Lille OSC |date=12 November 2007 |access-date=19 April 2011 |language=fr}}</ref> He appeared as a substitute in the match and, as a result of his performance, was included in the 18-man squad to face [[AS Nancy Lorraine|Nancy]] in a league match on 24 November,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://losc.fr/?saison=20072008&r=0,2,5,,1,24 |title=FC Bruges 1–3 LOSC |date=16 November 2007|access-date=19 April 2011 |publisher=Lille OSC |language=fr}}</ref> where he subsequently made his professional debut in the match, coming on as a substitute in the 78th minute.<ref>{{cite web |title=Nancy v.

===Early senior international career===
On 18 November 2008, Hazard was called up to the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium senior team]], for the first time, by manager [[René Vandereycken]] for the team's match against [[Luxembourg national football team|Luxembourg]]. Prior to making his national team debut with Belgium, Hazard was courted by [[French Football Federation]] officials who sought the player to play for the [[France national football team|France national team]] as he had become eligible for French citizenship. Hazard did not respond to the courtship and later stated "Because of my presence in France for seven years, I feel 99% Belgian and 1% French, but the idea of French citizenship has never crossed my mind".<ref>{{cite news |title=Eden Hazard aurait pu jouer avec les Bleus |url=http://www.chronofoot.com/%E9quipe-de-france/eden-hazard-aurait-pu-jouer-avec-les-bleus_art21429.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120729204015/http://www.chronofoot.com/%E9quipe-de-france/eden-hazard-aurait-pu-jouer-avec-les-bleus_art21429.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=29 July 2012 |publisher=Chronofoot |date=15 November 2011 |access-date=19 February 2012 |language=fr}}</ref>

Hazard made his highly anticipated debut for Belgium in the match against Luxembourg coming on as a substitute in the 67th minute for [[Wesley Sonck]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Belgium v.

Under Advocaat, Hazard became a starter in the team and, on 14 November 2009, played a full match for the first time in his international career. In the match, which was played against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], Hazard assisted two goals in a 3–0 win.{{citation needed|date=May 2023}}

In May 2010, Advocaat was replaced as manager by Georges Leekens. After featuring as a starter in Leekens first three matches in charge, Hazard began appearing as a substitute for Belgium during the 2010–11 season. Leekens justified his benching of Hazard citing the players' domestic performance, which had been underwhelming at the time, while also admitting that Hazard displayed a lack of desire in training with the national team and often neglected his defensive duties during international matches.<ref name="hazard_leekens"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Hazard-Leekens: l'incompréhension? |url=http://www.rtbf.be/sport/football/diablesrouges/detail_hazard-leekens-l-incomprehension?id=6550763 |publisher=RTBF |date=4 August 2011 |access-date=5 August 2011 |language=nl}}</ref> After appearing as a substitute in two straight matches, Hazard returned to the starting lineup for the team's November 2010 friendly against [[Russia national football team|Russia]].

After featuring as a starter in the team's 1–1 draw with [[Finland national football team|Finland]] in February 2011, Hazard was relegated back to the substitute's bench for the team's important March 2011 [[UEFA Euro 2012 qualifying]] matches as Leekens preferred [[Nacer Chadli]] and [[Mousa Dembélé (Belgian footballer)|Mousa Dembélé]] on the wings.<ref>{{cite news |title=Un problème Hazard? |url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/breves2011/20110329_091853_un-probleme-hazard.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401032902/http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/breves2011/20110329_091853_un-probleme-hazard.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=1 April 2011 |newspaper=L'Équipe |location=Paris |date=29 March 2011 |access-date=5 August 2011 |language=fr}}</ref> Following the matches, French media began questioning why Hazard was struggling to be appreciated in his home country, while, at the same time, was being praised in France.<ref>{{cite news |title=Hazard n'est pas prophète en son plat pays |url=http://www.rmcsport.fr/editorial/155082/hazard-n-est-pas-prophete-en-son-plat-pays/ |website=RMC Sport |date=31 March 2011 |access-date=5 August 2011 |language=fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120316005505/http://www.rmcsport.fr/editorial/155082/hazard-n-est-pas-prophete-en-son-plat-pays/ |archive-date=16 March 2012}}</ref> Marc Wilmots, assistant coach of the national team, responded to the media reports stating "Some people only see Eden's qualities" and "the French press are sometimes blinded by his moments of magic".<ref>{{cite web |title=Wilmots: Hazard needs more than talent |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=1409933.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405003525/http://www.fifa.com/worldfootball/news/newsid=1409933.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=5 April 2011 |publisher=FIFA |date=31 March 2011|access-date=5 August 2011}}</ref>

In Belgium's next competitive match against [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] on 3 June 2011, Hazard started the match, but was substituted out after 60 minutes.

==Player profile==
===Style of play===
[[File:Hazard taking on Howson.jpg|thumb|Hazard taking on the opposition team's defence while playing for [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] in 2012]]

Hazard primarily plays as either an [[attacking midfielder]] or a [[Winger (association football)|winger]] and has been credited as being "possibly the outstanding talent in Europe right now".<ref>{{cite web |title=The new Belgian golden generation |url=http://www.espnfc.com/story/770540/wim-van-walle-the-new-belgian-golden-generation |website=ESPN FC |first=Wim |last=Van Walle |date=15 April 2011 |access-date=19 April 2011}}</ref> At Lille under former manager Rudi Garcia, Hazard often played in the latter role in the team's 4–3–3 formation and regularly switched flanks because he could use both feet. Following the departures of fellow [[playmaker]]s [[Yohan Cabaye]] and Gervinho in 2011, during the 2011–12 season, Garcia played Hazard in a creative role as a central attacking midfielder, while also allowing the player to roam back onto the wing if necessary. Two of Hazard's most common exemplary traits are his pace and [[Dribbling (association football)|technical ability]], which have been described as "astonishing" and "mesmerizing".<ref name="hazard_fifa"/> His speed, acceleration, and dribbling skills, combined with his creativity,<ref name="hazard_espn">{{cite web |title=Eden Hazard |url=http://www.espnfc.com/player/101390/eden-hazard |website=ESPN FC|access-date=19 April 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/arsenal-potential-transfer-targets-1829591.html |title=Arsenal: potential transfer targets |last=Leach |first=Jimmy |date=30 November 2009 |newspaper=The Independent|access-date=10 April 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203124445/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/arsenal-potential-transfer-targets-1829591.html?action=Popup&ino=4|archive-date=3 December 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chelseafc.com/en/news/2019/03/05/eden-hazard-s-top-assists |title=EDEN HAZARD'S TOP CHELSEA ASSISTS |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |date=5 March 2019 |access-date=18 February 2020}}</ref> as well as his flair, balance, agility, and low centre of gravity, courtesy of his diminutive stature (1.73 m/5 feet 8 inches),<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.chelseafc.com/en/teams/first-team/eden-hazard |title=Eden Hazard |publisher=Chelsea F.C. |access-date=1 July 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190502194948/https://www.chelseafc.com/en/teams/first-team/eden-hazard |archive-date=2 May 2019}}</ref> allow him to retain possession, take on defenders, and beat opponents in one on one situations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1978449-eden-hazard-what-makes-him-the-best-player-in-the-premier-league |title=Eden Hazard Showing Class That Makes Him Best Player in the Premier League |last=Levene |first=Dan |website=Bleacher Report |date=2 March 2014 |access-date=17 December 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.com/soccer/blog/the-toe-poke/65/post/3188122/eden-hazard-among-chelsea-stars-put-through-speed-dribbling-test |title=Eden Hazard among Chelsea stars put through speed dribbling test |last=Twomey |first=Liam |publisher=ESPN |date=25 August 2017 |access-date=17 December 2018}}</ref>
