[[File:20150331 Mali vs Ghana 157.jpg|thumb|André Ayew as captain of Ghana versus Mali in 2015]]

=== Youth ===

Due to having dual [[French passport|French]] and [[Ghanaian passport|Ghanaian]] citizenship, Ayew was eligible for [[France national football team|France]] and [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]]. He initially chose to represent France, citing the failed inquiries of the [[Ghana Football Association]] to contact him as his reason why, but declared Ghana to be his first option, citing his father. Ayew was subsequently called up and participated in a training camp with the [[France national under-18 football team|France under-18 team]]. In 2007, he turned down several offers to play for the country's [[France national under-21 football team|under-21 team]]. Ayew later warned the Ghana Football Association that he was on the verge of representing France at international level, stating, "At this moment there is only one choice to make because I have only received an invitation from one country and that is France."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/6899124.stm |title='Dede' could play for France |access-date=26 June 2010 |date=14 July 2007 |publisher=British Broadcasting Company}}</ref>

The championship victory resulted in the team qualifying for the ensuing U-20 World Cup. In the tournament, Ayew scored twice against [[England national under-20 football team|England]] in a 4–0 rout and the equalizing goal against South Africa in the round of 16. Ghana later won the match in [[extra time]] through a goal from [[Dominic Adiyiah]]. Ayew then [[Captain (association football)|captained]] the team to victories over the [[Korea Republic national under-20 football team|South Korea]] and [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in the quarter-finals and semi-finals, respectively, to reach the final where they faced [[Brazil national under-20 football team|Brazil]]. In the final, Ghana defeated the Brazilians 4–3 on penalties to win the U-20 World Cup. Ayew converted Ghana's first penalty in the [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|shootout]].{{Citation needed paragraph|date=February 2022}}
