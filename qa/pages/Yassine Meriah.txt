'''Yassine Meriah''' ({{lang-ar|ياسين مرياح}}; born 2 July 1993) is a Tunisian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)|defender]] for [[Espérance Sportive de Tunis|Espérance Tunis]] and the [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia national team]].

==Club career==
Mariah was formed in [[AS Ariana]], the team that was active in the [[Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 2]]. In the 2013–14 season, he was transferred to [[ES Métlaoui|Étoile de Métlaoui]] when he was 20 years old. After spending two seasons with the team, he was prominently featured and invited to the Tunisian Olympic team. He attracted the attention of the officials of [[Club Sportif Sfaxien|Club Sfaxien]], one of the most important teams in the [[Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 1]] who sought to sign with him, starting from the 2014–15 season. From his first season with Club Sfaxien, Meriah was a key figure in the squad and played in many of the team's defensive positions.

===Olympiacos===
On 28 July 2018, Meriah joined [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]] for an estimated transfer fee of €1,500,000, signing a four-year contract.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.gazzetta.gr/football/superleague/article/1255003/anakoinose-ton-meria-o-olympiakos |title=Aνακοίνωσε τον Μεριά ο Ολυμπιακός |access-date=28 July 2018 |language=el}}</ref> On 2 September 2018, he scored his first goal for the club in a 5–0 home win against [[PAS Giannina F.C.|PAS Giannina]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.gazzetta.gr/football/superleague/article/1265726/olympiakos-pas-giannina-5-0 |title=Ολυμπιακός - ΠΑΣ Γιάννινα 5-0 |access-date=2 September 2018 |language=el}}</ref>

On 31 January 2020, Meriah officially loaned in [[Süper Lig]] club [[Kasımpaşa S.K.|Kasımpaşa]], until the end of the 2019–20 season, with a €5 million buyout clause expected in the summer. Meriah started this year as de facto leader in Olympiakos defence, having a great presence in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League qualifiers]]. Later, however, there were some games in which he made mistakes, so he was sidelined.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.sport24.gr/football/omades/Olympiakos/olympiakos-anakoinwse-meria-h-kasimpasa.5676711.html |title=Ολυμπιακός: Ανακοίνωσε Μεριά η Κασίμπασα |date=31 January 2020 |language=el}}</ref> On 13 September 2020, he signed a long season loan with another [[Süper Lig]] club [[Çaykur Rizespor]].<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.sport24.gr/football/olympiakos-daneikos-gia-ena-chrono-sti-rizespor-o-meria.8991993.html |title=Ολυμπιακός: Δανεικός για ένα χρόνο στη Ρίζεσπορ ο Μεριά |date=13 September 2020 |language=el}}</ref>
