'''Daley Blind''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈdeːli ˈblɪnt}}; born 9 March 1990) is a Dutch professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]], [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left-back]] or [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre-back]] for [[La Liga]] club [[Girona FC|Girona]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]]. He is the son of former Ajax defender and former Netherlands national team manager [[Danny Blind]].

Blind rose through the youth ranks at Ajax, becoming a regular after a loan to [[FC Groningen|Groningen]], and won four consecutive [[Eredivisie]] titles with the club. In September 2014, he transferred to Manchester United for £13.8 million, where he was part of the team that won four trophies including the [[2016 FA Cup Final|FA Cup]], [[2017 EFL Cup Final|EFL Cup]] and [[2017 UEFA Europa League Final|UEFA Europa League]]. In the summer of 2018, Blind returned to Ajax, where he won his fifth Eredivisie title and first-ever [[KNVB Cup]] in his first season back at the club.

A full international since 2013, Blind has earned over 100 caps and was a member of the Dutch squad that finished third at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]]. He has since featured at [[UEFA Euro 2020]] and the [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cup]].

==Club career==
===Ajax===
Blind began his career in the youth academy of his hometown club, [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]]; the same club where his father [[Danny Blind|Danny]] made his name as a professional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajaxshowtime.com/index.php?msg=33171&page=1|title=Ajax Showtime - Nieuws over Ajax, Jong Ajax en Ajax-jeugd|website=ajaxshowtime.com}}</ref> Blind is a product of the [[Jong Ajax|Ajax youth system]] and, while officially still a B-junior, he became a mainstay in the A-juniors during the 2007–08 season.<ref name="ajax_contract"/> before earning promotion to the Ajax first-team for the 2008–09 season.<ref name="ajax_debut">{{cite web |url=http://english.ajax.nl/web/show/id=154814/contentid=68236 |title=Blind helps Ajax win in debut |publisher=Ajax.nl |date=7 December 2008 |access-date=11 December 2008 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217140444/http://english.ajax.nl/web/show/id%3D154814/contentid%3D68236 |archive-date=17 December 2008 }}</ref> He was a midfielder through his journey up the Ajax youth levels, often playing the 'No. 6' or 'third centre-back' role.

On 7 December 2008, Blind made his debut in the Ajax first-team in the away match against [[FC Volendam]].

On 5 January 2010, he joined [[FC Groningen|Groningen]] on loan for the remainder of the 2009–10 season, during the winter transfer window.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://english.ajax.nl/News/Archive/Article/Daley-Blind-on-loan-to-FC-Groningen.htm |title=Daley Blind on loan to FC Groningen |publisher=Ajax.nl |date=5 January 2010 |access-date=27 April 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100109033001/http://english.ajax.nl/News/Archive/Article/Daley-Blind-on-loan-to-FC-Groningen.htm |archive-date=9 January 2010 }}</ref> At Groningen, Blind was mainly used as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right-back]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ajaxlife.nl/updates/daley-blind-maakt-furore-bij-fc-groningen |title=Daley Blind maakt furore bij FC Groningen |publisher=[[Ajax Life]] |date=26 March 2010 |access-date=31 August 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140903145352/http://www.ajaxlife.nl/updates/daley-blind-maakt-furore-bij-fc-groningen |archive-date=3 September 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref> He was almost sold to Groningen for €1.5 million by Ajax on a permanent basis but the move did not materialize.<ref name="Love is 'Blind': Profiling Ajax & Netherlands stalwart Daley Blind"/>

====Back from loan spell====
[[File:Daley_Blind_6013.jpg|thumb|upright|Blind playing for Ajax in 2011]]
The following two seasons saw Blind contribute to two [[Eredivisie]] national championships with Ajax, for the [[2010–11 Eredivisie|2010–11 season]], and the [[2011–12 Eredivisie|2011–12 season]], the first of which would be Ajax's 30th championship title. However, Blind's performances when given the chance were unconvincing and he was even booed off the field in an Eredivisie game.<ref name="Love is 'Blind': Profiling Ajax & Netherlands stalwart Daley Blind"/> Under newly appointed manager [[Frank de Boer]], Blind would be given more and more trust and playing time, earning him the place as the first choice [[Defender (association football)|left-back]] with a permanent starting position during the 2012–13 season.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nos.nl/video/442809-blind-exponent-nieuw-ajax.html |title=Blind, exponent nieuw Ajax (Dutch) |publisher=NOS.nl |date=20 November 2012 |access-date=6 February 2013}}</ref>

On 23 April 2013, it was announced by [[Marc Overmars]] that Ajax and Blind had reached an agreement to extend his contract for three years, binding him to the club until the summer of 2016.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ad.nl/ad/nl/1441/Ajax/article/detail/3430068/2013/04/22/Blind-verlengt-contract-bij-Ajax.dhtml |title=Blind verlengt contract bij Ajax (Dutch) |work=Algemeen Dagblad|date=23 April 2013 |access-date=24 April 2013}}</ref> On 5 May, Blind contributed to Ajax's third Dutch [[Eredivisie]] title in a row, marking the club's 32nd national title, helping to defeat [[Willem II (football club)|Willem II]] 5–0 at home, and securing the top position on the table just one match day from season's end. Later that day it was announced that Blind had been declared AFC Ajax Player of the Year for the [[2012–13 AFC Ajax season|2012–13 season]], after playing an outstanding fifth year for Ajax, from the starting left-back position.

During the [[2013–14 Eredivisie|2013–14 season]], De Boer moved Blind back to his natural defensive central midfielder position and was named [[Dutch Footballer of the Year]] as Ajax won a fourth consecutive league title.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/players/player=319432/profile-detail.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140612023413/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/players/player=319432/profile-detail.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=12 June 2014|title=Daley Blind|access-date=17 June 2014|publisher=FIFA}}</ref>

[[File:Daley Blind vs Aleksandr Erokhin 2017.jpg|thumb|Blind playing for Manchester United in 2017]]
Blind made his debut 13 days after his signing, playing the full 90 minutes as United beat [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]] 4–0 at [[Old Trafford]] for their first victory of the season.<ref>{{cite news|title=Man Utd 4–0 QPR|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29098240|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=14 September 2014}}</ref> His first goal for the club came on 20 October, a 20-yard strike that earned United a 2–2 draw at [[West Bromwich Albion]].<ref>{{cite news|title=West Brom 2–2 Man Utd|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/29592002|access-date=21 October 2014|work=BBC Sport|date=20 October 2014}}</ref>

On 11 January 2015, Blind returned to the United team, starting in defence in a 1–0 loss to [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] at Old Trafford.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/match-reports/manchester-united-0-1-southampton-saints-4959760|title=Manchester United 0–1 Southampton: Saints leapfrog United into third after Dusan Tadic seals shock win|date=11 January 2015|access-date=26 January 2015|work=The Mirror}}</ref> On 8 February, he scored an injury-time equaliser for United in a 1–1 draw against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/31079343 |title=West Ham 1–1 Man Utd |work=BBC Sport |date=8 February 2015 |access-date=10 February 2015 |first=Neil |last=Johnston}}</ref>

Although throughout the previous season Blind was used as a defensive midfielder or left-back, Blind started the season as a centre-back, where he played for the majority of the season. On 12 September 2015, he scored his first goal of the season in a 3–1 win against [[Liverpool F.C|Liverpool]] at [[Old Trafford]], also being named man of the match for his performance.<ref>{{cite news |first=Phil |last=McNulty |title=Man Utd 3–1 Liverpool |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/34160795 |publisher=BBC Sport (British Broadcasting Corporation) |date=12 September 2015 |access-date=13 September 2015 }}</ref>

He began the [[2016–17 Premier League]] season as first choice center-back alongside [[Chris Smalling]], however, lost his place in the team following a return to form of [[Phil Jones (footballer, born 1992)|Phil Jones]] and [[Marcos Rojo]]. He worked his way back to the first-team, but featured mostly at left-back, replacing first choice left-back [[Luke Shaw]]. He scored his first goal of the season against Sunderland on Boxing Day, charging into the box to connect with a pass from [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]] and finishing low into the bottom corner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/match/manchester-united-vs-sunderland/2241935|title=Manchester United v Sunderland Live Commentary & Result, 26/12/2016, Premier League |website=goal.com|publisher=Goal|date=26 December 2016|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref> He started the Europa League final against his former team Ajax, which Manchester United won 2–0.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thebusbybabe.sbnation.com/2017/5/24/15686214/manchester-united-vs-ajax-lineups-team-news-europa-league-final|title=Manchester United vs. Ajax lineups: Blind, Fellaini and Mkhitaryan all handed starts|website=thebusbybabe.com|date=24 May 2017|access-date=7 April 2020}}</ref>
