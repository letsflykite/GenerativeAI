'''Jan Bert Lieve Vertonghen''' (born 24 April 1987) is a Belgian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays for [[Belgian Pro League|Pro League]] club [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] and the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]]. Mainly a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]], he can also play as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left-back]].

Vertonghen began his senior career at Dutch club [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in 2006 and totalled 220 games and 28 goals for them across all competitions, serving as their captain from 2011 to 2012. He won two [[Eredivisie]] and two [[KNVB Cup]] titles during his time at the club, and in 2012 he was named [[Dutch Footballer of the Year]]. Vertonghen transferred to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in July 2012, and made the [[PFA Team of the Year]] in his first [[Premier League]] season. He made 315 appearances for Spurs over eight years, and won their player of the year award in 2018.

Vertonghen made his international debut for Belgium in 2007 and his 148 caps (including [[Belgium national football team results – unofficial matches#2010s|three unofficial games]], according to FIFA rules) are the [[Belgium national football team#Most capped players|most in the history of the national team]]. He was part of Belgian squads that came fourth at the [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2008 Olympics]], finishing third at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], and the round of 16 at [[UEFA Euro 2020|Euro 2020]].

==Early life==
Vertonghen was born in [[Sint-Niklaas]], Belgium, to Ria Mattheeuws and Paul Vertonghen.<ref name=IndyDec2012>{{Cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/exclusive-interview-jan-vertonghen-spurred-on-by-tottenhams-fight-for-fourth-8418339.html |title=Exclusive interview: Jan Vertonghen spurred on by Tottenham's fight |last=Wallace |first=Sam |date=15 December 2012 |newspaper=The Independent |access-date=24 December 2016}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.90min.com/posts/4304829-spurs-star-s-mother-admits-white-hart-lane-exit-could-be-close-due-to-homesickness-issues|title=Spurs Star's Mother Admits White Hart Lane Exit Could Be Close Due to 'Homesickness' Issues|last=Flavius|first=Kavan|date=21 December 2016|website=90min.com |access-date=24 December 2016}}</ref> He has two brothers, Ward and Lode; both have played football.<ref name=IndyDec2012/>

==Club career==
===Ajax===
[[File:Shevchenko vertonghen.jpg|thumb|upright|Vertonghen (right) playing for Ajax in 2010]]

After spending time at VK Tielrode and [[Germinal Beerschot]], Vertonghen moved to the Netherlands and signed a contract with the youth academy of [[Eredivisie]] side [[AFC Ajax]]. He began as a midfielder but then became a regular at centre-back for Ajax.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jan Vertonghen tevreden met positie bij Ajax|url=http://www.voetbalcentraal.nl/nieuws/39673/jan-vertonghen-tevreden-met-positie-bij-ajax-list|work=Voetbal Centraal|date=12 November 2009|language=nl}}</ref> During his time in the [[Jong Ajax|reserves]], he became known for an incident in a [[2005–06 KNVB Cup|2006 KNVB Cup]] game against [[Cambuur Leeuwarden]], his first home game at the [[Amsterdam Arena]], where he scored a goal to put Ajax 3–0 up. He had attempted a back pass to the Cambuur goalkeeper while a teammate was receiving treatment but instead the ball went into the goal. Since it was unintentional, Ajax allowed Cambuur to score a goal in return.<ref>{{cite news|title=Gatorade Cup: Young Ajax beat Cambuur in memorable game|url=http://www.ajaxusa.com/news/2005-2006/gatorade-cup-young-ajax-beat-cambuur-in-memorable-game.html|publisher=Ajax USA|date=20 September 2005}}</ref> On 23 August 2006, Vertonghen made his first team debut in the [[2006–07 UEFA Champions League#Third qualifying round|Champions League third qualifying round]] against [[F.C. Copenhagen|Copenhagen]]. He made his first start and Eredivisie debut in a 6–0 win over [[Willem II Tilburg|Willem II]] at the Amsterdam Arena and would play another two matches for the first half of the season.

====Loan to RKC====
After the winter break of the [[2006–07 Eredivisie|2006–07 season]], he was sent on [[Loan (association football)|loan]] to struggling [[RKC Waalwijk]] for the remainder of the season. At RKC, he would play 12 matches in which he scored three times, but he was unable to help the team avoid relegation to the [[Eerste Divisie]]. One of his goals with RKC Waalwijk was against his parent club, Ajax, in a 2–2 draw, which eventually let Ajax finish second in the league on only one goal difference with [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.planetfootball.com/quick-reads/seven-times-loanees-faced-against-their-parent-clubs-courtois-coman-lualua/ |title=10 times loanees haunted their parent club: Coutinho, Vertonghen… |website=planetfootball.com |date=15 August 2020 }}</ref>

====Breakthrough at Ajax====
[[File:Vertonghen Ajax skipper.jpg|thumb|upright|Vertonghen with Ajax in 2011]]

Vertonghen returned to Ajax for the [[2007–08 Eredivisie|2007–08 season]], where he was tipped for stardom, but was unable to break through due to a severe injury and the presence of central defenders [[John Heitinga]] and [[Thomas Vermaelen]]. [[Johan Cruyff]] had made no secret of his admiration for the left-footed youngster who can handle any left-sided position in defence and midfield, opting, on 26 September 2008, to extend his contract to 30 June 2013.

The [[2008–09 Eredivisie|2008–09 season]] was a breakthrough season for the young defender. After John Heitinga left for [[Atlético Madrid]], Vertonghen became Thomas Vermaelen's first-choice partner in central defence; the former started 23 of the 26 games he played in and scored four goals. On 28 September, he scored a rare double against [[Vitesse Arnhem|Vitesse]] in a 3–0 win. Although sustaining an injury from training during the week, he played in the match against [[FC Groningen|Groningen]] on 24 January, billed as a "must-win" match by coach [[Marco van Basten]];<ref>{{cite news|title=Preview: FC Groningen vs Ajax Amsterdam|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/preview?id=249496&cc=3888&league=NED.1|work=[[ESPN Soccernet]]|date=25 January 2009}}</ref> Vertonghen was unfortunate enough to be sent off for two yellow cards as Ajax lost 1–0. He was out for a month after sustaining a hamstring injury in an away win on 1 March against [[FC Utrecht|Utrecht]], but his return lasted only several games after his season was prematurely ended after aggravating another injury.

====Rising importance under Jol====
Under new coach [[Martin Jol]], Vertonghen retained his place in the starting line-up for the [[2009–10 Eredivisie|2009–10 season]]. Despite injuring his toe while on international duty against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] the previous week, he scored his first goal of the season, a free kick, in a 6–0 thrashing of [[NAC Breda]] on 13 September.<ref>{{cite news|title=Match Report: Ajax Amsterdam vs NAC Breda|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=271828&cc=3888&league=NED.1|work=ESPN Soccernet|date=13 September 2009|access-date=27 October 2009|archive-date=19 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019223058/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=271828&cc=3888&league=NED.1|url-status=dead}}</ref> With the departure of Thomas Vermaelen to [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], he and fellow Belgian [[Toby Alderweireld]] become the first choice centre-back pairing and soon became a firm fans' favourite.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jol: 'Vertonghen is een echte Hollander'|url=http://www.gva.be/nieuws/sport/video/extern-jol-vertonghen-is-een-echte-hollander.aspx|work=[[Gazet van Antwerpen]]|date=26 September 2009|access-date=27 October 2009|language=nl}}</ref> Despite Ajax's erratic form in the latter weeks leading up to the winter break, he turned in some strong performances and attracted the interest of a number of clubs, including [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]], but he played down the rumours, stating his intent to at least see out his contract with Ajax.<ref>{{cite news|title=Jan Vertonghen in beeld bij FC Barcelona|url=http://www.depers.nl/sport/441704/Vertonghen-in-beeld-bij-Barça.html|work=[[De Pers]]|date=17 February 2010|language=nl|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100224031455/http://www.depers.nl/sport/441704/Vertonghen-in-beeld-bij-Bar%C3%A7a.html|archive-date=24 February 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Guardiola estaría siguiendo a Vertonghen|url=http://www.sport.es/default.asp?idpublicacio_PK=44&idioma=CAS&idnoticia_PK=687794&idseccio_PK=803|work=[[Sport (Spanish newspaper)|Sport]]|date=16 February 2010|language=es}}</ref>

After the winter break, Ajax went on a nine-game unbeaten streak in the league, with Vertonghen playing a key role. Their run of six consecutive clean sheets was ended in a 4–1 home win over [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]] when the visiting side were awarded a penalty. Vertonghen was linked with a move to [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], and later he was also linked with [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], stating, "I've heard Milan Director [[Adriano Galliani]] talk about me after the Champions League match in [[San Siro]] and his words were very flattering."<ref>{{cite web|title=Vertonghen linked to Milan|url=http://goal-arena.com/2011/02/vertonghen-linked-to-milan|publisher=Goal-arena.com|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110216043647/http://goal-arena.com/2011/02/vertonghen-linked-to-milan/|archive-date=16 February 2011}}</ref>

Vertonghen stated on numerous occasions late in the [[2010–11 Eredivisie|2010–11 season]] that he was considering leaving Ajax at the end of that season.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Vertonghen weighing up move |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11906_6722248,00.html |website=Sky Sports |date=4 February 2011|access-date=22 May 2011}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |title=Ajax star targets Prem switch |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_6921360,00.html |website=Sky Sports |date=8 May 2011}}</ref> In May 2011, [[Frank de Boer]] confirmed [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] boss [[Roberto Mancini]] was present at the [[2010–11 KNVB Cup|2011 KNVB Cup Final]] held on 7 May 2011, where Vertonghen's side lost 3–2 to [[FC Twente|Twente]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_6925317,00.html|title=City keep eye on Vertonghen|date=13 May 2011|website=Sky Sports}}</ref> Mancini was reportedly scouting Vertonghen to strengthen his side after they had qualified for the [[UEFA Champions League]] 2011–12 campaign.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/918003/man-city-scout-jan-vertonghen,-axel-witsel-and-kevin-de-bruyne?cc=5901|title=City scout Belgian trio|date=10 May 2011|work=ESPN Soccernet|access-date=10 May 2011|archive-date=24 October 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024215954/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/918003/man-city-scout-jan-vertonghen,-axel-witsel-and-kevin-de-bruyne?cc=5901|url-status=dead}}</ref>

====Breakthrough under De Boer====
[[File:Basis Elftal Ajax 14Sep2011.jpg|thumb|upright|Vertonghen (top right) [[Captain (association football)|captain]]ing Ajax in 2011]]

During the [[2011–12 Eredivisie]] season, Vertonghen emerged as one of Ajax's best players, demonstrating his versatility to cover multiple positions after Ajax had let several regular players out on long-term loans. After an impressive season, including a performance for which he was singled out for praise against Manchester United in the [[UEFA Europa League]] Round of 16, he was named the 2011–12 [[Dutch Footballer of the Year|Eredivisie Player of the Year]]. Named team captain by [[Frank de Boer]], he led his Ajax to their second title in a row, scoring eight goals in 31 league games, highlighting his attacking strengths. Also, for the second time, he dropped the Championship plate. "Now it falls on my toe&nbsp;– this plate just does not like me," Vertonghen said.<ref>{{cite web|title=Season review: Netherlands|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/association=ned/news/newsid=1800379.html#season+review+netherlands|publisher=by Berend Scholten on UEFA.com|access-date=22 May 2012}}</ref>

===Tottenham Hotspur===
====2012–13 season====
Throughout the 2011–12 season, Vertonghen was linked with English club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and publicly expressed his desire to make the move to [[White Hart Lane]] ahead of numerous other teams. A key factor in this was his desire to play as a centre-back, with Arsenal wanting to use him as a defensive midfielder. On 8 July 2012, Tottenham agreed a fee and terms for Vertonghen subject to a medical. On 12 July, Tottenham announced that they had officially completed the signing of Vertonghen, for an amount around 12 million Euros, after he successfully completed his medical.<ref>{{cite web|title=Jan Vertonghen completes Tottenham move from Ajax|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/18761297|website=BBC Sport |date=12 July 2012 |access-date=14 August 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Tottenham on the verge of completing transfer of Jan Vertonghen|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/jul/08/tottenham-signing-jan-vertonghen-ajax|work=The Guardian |date=8 July 2012 |access-date=31 January 2018}}</ref> Vertonghen took part in his first game as a Tottenham player in a 3–2 [[Friendly (association football)|friendly]] win against [[Brentford F.C.|Brentford]] on 14 July, then later scored his first goal for the club on 26 September in a 3–0 win against [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]] in the third round of the [[Football League Cup]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19645193 |title=Carlisle 0–3 Tottenham |website=BBC Sport |date=26 September 2012 |access-date=29 September 2012}}</ref>

Vertonghen scored his first [[Premier League]] goal against Manchester United in a historic 2–3 win at [[Old Trafford]], although this was later ruled to be an own goal by [[Jonny Evans]].<ref>[http://www1.skysports.com/football/live/match/261615/report "Spurs end United hoodoo"] Sky Sports. 29 September 2012.

====2014–15 season====
[[File:Jan Vertonghen 20151129.jpg|thumb|upright|Vertonghen playing for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] in 2015]]

At the start of the [[2014–15 Premier League|2014–15 season]], Vertonghen appeared to be out of favour with new manager [[Mauricio Pochettino]]. The Argentine gave Vertonghen limited games, preferring [[Younès Kaboul]] and [[Federico Fazio]]. However, Kaboul lost his place to Vertonghen, who formed an effective partnership with Fazio. Together, the pair, over the span of 15 games, celebrated 11 wins and only suffered one loss. Vertonghen helped Spurs to reach the [[2015 Football League Cup Final|2015 League Cup Final]] and started the game on 1 March 2015, but Tottenham lost to [[Chelsea F.C.–Tottenham Hotspur F.C. rivalry|rival]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] 2–0.<ref name=2015LeagueCupFinal>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/31572594 |title=Chelsea 2–0 Tottenham Hotspur |first=Phil |last=McNulty |website=BBC Sport |date=1 March 2015 |access-date=15 December 2017}}</ref>

====2015–16 season====
Vertonghen was joined in defence by former Ajax teammate and compatriot Alderweireld at the start of the [[2015–16 Premier League|2015–16 season]]. Over the first ten games of the season, Vertonghen and Alderweireld played ten out of the opening ten games together, with Spurs suffering only one loss during the span.

==International career==
[[File:Jan Vertonghen Belgium.jpg|thumb|upright|Vertonghen with [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]]]]

Vertonghen made his international debut at the under-21 level in 2006 and played in the [[2007 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2007 UEFA U21 Championships]].

On 2 June 2007, he made his senior debut for the [[Belgium national football team|national team]] in a 2–1 home loss against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]] in [[UEFA Euro 2008]] qualification. At the end of the game he was fouled by substitute striker [[Hugo Almeida]], who was sent off.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Van Damme |first1=Michaël |title=Stijnen: 'Een rare zwieper'|trans-title=Stijnen: 'A weird bump' |url=https://www.nieuwsblad.be/cnt/dmf02062007_051 |access-date=18 September 2020 |work=Nieuwsblad |date=2 June 2007 |language=nl}}</ref> Vertonghen was also selected for the 2008 Olympics and played in every match as the Belgians unexpectedly took fourth place.

In the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2010 World Cup qualifying]], he began to establish himself as a regular, initially at centre-back as former Ajax teammate [[Thomas Vermaelen]]'s partner. He scored the opening goal, also his first ever international goal,<ref>{{cite news|title=Vertonghen: "Moeten dringend eens maturiteit tonen"|url=http://belgiumsoccer.be/nieuws/lees/2009-08-13/vertonghen-moeten-dringend-eens-maturiteit-tonen|language=nl|work=Belgiumsoccer.be|date=13 August 2009|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706133000/http://www.belgiumsoccer.be/nieuws/lees/2009-08-13/vertonghen-moeten-dringend-eens-maturiteit-tonen|archive-date=6 July 2011}}</ref> in an August 2009 friendly against the Czech Republic that ended in a 3–1 loss.
