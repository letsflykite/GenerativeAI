Ochoa made his senior level professional debut for [[Club América]] in 2004, winning the league title the following year and was the club's first-choice goalkeeper up until 2011, making over 200 appearances for América. That summer Ochoa was transferred to [[AC Ajaccio|Ajaccio]] in France.<ref name="Rivas">{{cite web|last=Rivas|first=Cristian|date=13 July 2013|title=Guillermo Ochoa, veintiocho veranos de vida y éxitos|url=http://www.goal.com/es-mx/news/4783/mexicanos-por-el-mundo/2013/07/13/4115584/guillermo-ochoa-veintiocho-veranos-de-vida-y-éxitos|publisher=Goal (in Spanish)|access-date=20 July 2013}}</ref> He spent three seasons with the club until their relegation from [[Ligue 1]].

In July 2017, he joined [[Standard Liège]]. He returned to Club América in August 2019. 

A Mexican international since 2005, Ochoa received his first cap at age 20 in a friendly match against [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]]. Having been included in the squads for five [[FIFA World Cup]]s ([[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]], [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]], [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022]]), Ochoa has gained international recognition for his consistency and big game performances in the competition over multiple iterations.<ref>{{cite web|date=22 November 2022|title=Mexico's Guillermo Ochoa Hailed as World Cup Legend After Penalty Save vs. Poland|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/10056496-mexicos-guillermo-ochoa-hailed-as-world-cup-legend-after-penalty-save-vs-poland|access-date=23 November 2022|website=Bleacher Report}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=22 November 2022|title=Memo Ochoa Still Has More World Cup Magic In Him|url=https://defector.com/memo-ochoa-still-has-more-world-cup-magic-in-him/|access-date=23 November 2022|website=Defector}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|date=22 November 2022|title=Ochoa is football heritage!

==Club career==
===América===
[[File:MemoOchoa1.jpg|180px|thumbnail|left|Ochoa with [[Club América|América]] in 2006]]
Guillermo Ochoa made his debut with [[Club América|América]] during the [[Primera División de México Clausura 2004|Clausura 2004]] tournament against [[C.F. Monterrey|Monterrey]], being only 18 years old when called up by head coach [[Leo Beenhakker]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Memo Ochoa es un orgullo de Leo Beenhakker, el DT que lo debutó|url=http://espndeportes.espn.com/news/nota/_/id/2146600/memo-ochoa-es-un-orgullo-de-leo-beenhakker-el-dt-que-lo-debuto|work=ESPN|language=es|date=1 August 2014|access-date=17 October 2018}}</ref> Ochoa quickly demonstrated his skill and talent in goal, and the young goalkeeper was thrust into the spotlight to replace injured veteran [[Adolfo Ríos]]. He would then share the starting job with Ríos after he recovered from his aforementioned injury. At the conclusion of his first season, he won the Rookie of the Tournament award.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fue el mejor novato|url=https://www.espn.com.mx/nota?id=268734|work=ESPN|date=5 October 2004|language=es}}</ref>

When the [[Primera División de México Apertura 2004|Apertura 2004]] tournament began, Ochoa was thought to be the heir apparent to Ríos, who had retired. However, new head coach [[Oscar Ruggeri]] brought new goalkeepers with him, among them Argentine [[Sebastián Saja]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Guillermo Ochoa buscará jugar cinco mundiales|url=http://espndeportes.espn.com/noticias/nota?s=mex&id=543607&type=story|work=ESPN|first=Héctor|last=Huerta|language=es|date=4 April 2007|access-date=17 October 2018}}</ref> Ruggeri's stay at the club was marred by controversy and unpopular decisions. He was fired after only six games into the season and Ochoa was soon reinstated by new coach [[Mario Carrillo]]. Thereafter, he started every game for Club América save for incidents involving injuries or national team duty. Under Carrillo, Ochoa won his first championship with América following the [[Primera División de México Clausura 2005|Clausura 2005]] season.<ref name="MedioTiempo.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/mexico/cronicas/2005/05/29/cronica-america-6-3-tecos_7478|title=¡AMÉRICA, ARROLLADOR CAMPEÓN!

In October 2007, Ochoa was named in ''[[France Football]]'''s list of candidates for the [[Ballon d'Or]], being one of only three players named to not play in Europe.<ref>{{cite web|title=Guillermo Ochoa es candidato para el Balón de Oro 2007 |url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/mexico/noticias/2007/10/21/memo-ochoa-candidato-al-balon-de-oro |work=MedioTiempo.com |access-date=21 October 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.rsssf.org/miscellaneous/europa-poy07.html |title= European Footballer of the Year ("Ballon d'Or") 2007 |publisher= [[Rec.Sport.Soccer Statistics Foundation|RSSSF]] |date= 9 October 2008}}</ref>

Ochoa would start 2008 in impressive form, helping América win the [[2008 InterLiga|InterLiga]] tournament with excellent performances, most notably in the group match against [[Monarcas Morelia]], where he saved a late penalty kick, and América's 1–0 lead.<ref name="Nunca pensé que podríamos perder: B">{{cite web|url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/santander-libertadores/reacciones/2008/01/13/nunca-pense-que-podriamos-perder-brailovsky_14900|title=Nunca pensé que podríamos perder: Brailovsky|work=MedioTiempo.com|language=es|date=13 January 2008|access-date=23 January 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151212052405/http://www.mediotiempo.com/futbol/santander-libertadores/reacciones/2008/01/13/nunca-pense-que-podriamos-perder-brailovsky_14900|archive-date=12 December 2015}}</ref>

In the winter of 2010, there was much speculation by various sources in England as to where Ochoa would move to for the 2011–12 season.

Ochoa's last season with América was the [[2010–11 Primera División de México season#Clausura|Clausura 2011]],<ref>{{MedioTiempo|id=guillermo-ochoa}}</ref> which ended with a quarter-final defeat to Monarcas Morelia.<ref>[http://deportes.aollatino.com/2011/05/08/america-eliminado-de-liguilla/: "Morelia elimina al América de la Liguilla"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180617165321/http://deportes.aollatino.com/2011/05/08/america-eliminado-de-liguilla/: |date=17 June 2018 }}.

==Style of play==
Karla Villegas Gamas of ''[[Bleacher Report]]'' has described him "proven to be a safe keeper, with confidence and leadership. Despite [then] being 28 years old, Ochoa knows how to organize the defense and push his teammates toward perfection; it's no wonder why he wore El Tri's captain armband last March [2013]. His experience is vast, and that is why he knows how to handle pressure. ''Paco Memo'' has played in some of the most important tournaments in world football, such as the Confederations Cup, Gold Cup and Copa America. Ochoa’s aerial game is enviable. He can catch a cross or a shot, but he can also deflect them with high dives with the top hand and punches. But those are not his only assets. His reflexes are so sharp that he can perform a collapse dive with one hand with ease, even if he has just rejected a shot. When the rivals made it past the defense, Ochoa knows how to work inside the box to cover his goal as much as possible by narrowing the angle."<ref>{{cite web|title=Why Guillermo Ochoa Should Start in Mexico's World Cup Opener in Brazil|url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1953395-why-guillermo-ochoa-should-start-in-mexicos-world-cup-opener-in-brazil|work=Bleacher Report|first=Karla|last=Villegas Gama|date=8 February 2014|access-date=25 September 2018}}</ref>
