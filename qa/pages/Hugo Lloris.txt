'''Hugo Hadrien Dominique Lloris''' (born 26 December 1986) is a French professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for and [[Captain (association football)|captains]] {{English football updater|TottenhH}} club [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]]. He is a three-time winner of the [[Union Nationale des Footballeurs Professionels|National Union of Professional Footballers]] (UNFP) [[Trophées UNFP du football#Goalkeeper of the Year|Ligue 1 Goalkeeper of the Year]] award.

Lloris began his career with hometown club [[OGC Nice]], made his debut as a teenager in October 2005 and started in goal during the team's run to the [[2006 Coupe de la Ligue Final]]. After excelling at the club for three seasons, Lloris moved to seven-time [[Ligue 1]] champions [[Olympique Lyonnais]], amid interest from several other clubs, notably [[A.C. Milan|Milan]]. Lloris won several domestic awards in his first season with Lyon and, in his second season, earned award nominations for his performances in the [[UEFA Champions League]], which saw Lyon reach the semi-finals for the first time. He joined Tottenham in 2012, and helped the team reach the Champions League final in [[2019 UEFA Champions League Final|2019]].

Lloris was a [[France national football team|French international]] having represented his nation at [[France national under-18 football team|under-18]], [[France national under-19 football team|under-19]], and [[France national under-21 football team|under-21]] level. Prior to playing at senior level, he played on the under-19 team that won the [[2005 UEFA European Under-19 Championship]]. Lloris made his senior international debut in November 2008 in a [[Friendly (association football)|friendly]] against [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. He helped France qualify for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] and was applauded by the media for his performance over two legs against the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]] in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA second round|qualifying playoffs]]. He captained the national team for the first time in 2010, and became first-choice captain on 28 February 2012, leading France into the quarter-finals of both [[UEFA Euro 2012]] and the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], as runners-up at [[UEFA Euro 2016]] and the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], and winning the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] held in Russia. He is France's most-[[capped]] player.

==Early life==
Lloris was born on 26 December 1986 in the Mediterranean city of [[Nice]] to an upper-class family.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Lloris started playing football at the age of six at CEDAC (Centre de Diffusion et d'Action Culturelle), a local [[cultural center]] based in the neighborhood of [[Cimiez]], Nice.<ref name ="deux_garçons">{{cite web |url=http://www.staderennais.com/index.php?rb=22&id=AT2539 |title=Pouplin – Lloris : Deux garçons pleins d'avenir |date=8 March 2007 |access-date=22 April 2010 |publisher=[[Stade Rennais F.C.]] |language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cedac-nice.com/presentation-CIMIEZ.html |title=Présentation du CEDAC Cimiez |access-date=16 April 2010 |publisher=CEDAC Cimiez |language=fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100409081208/http://www.cedac-nice.com/presentation-CIMIEZ.html |archive-date=9 April 2010}}</ref> The centre offered a variety of activities, which included football. Lloris played a variety of positions at the centre, such as [[Striker (association football)|in the attack]], before switching to the goalkeeper position after coaches noticed that he possessed impressive goalkeeping qualities, such as ball-handling and catching skills.<ref name ="deux_garçons" /> Lloris excelled at the position and caught the attention of former [[OGC Nice]] [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] and French international [[Dominique Baratelli]], who recommended that the player join his former club. At the age of ten, Lloris joined Nice's youth academy.<ref name ="deux_garçons" /> He spent several years in the club's youth academy and was the starting goalkeeper for the club's under-17 team that won the 2003–04 edition of the ''Championnat Nationaux des 18 ans'', a country-wide domestic league competition for players under the age of 18.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ogcnissa.com/fr.php?Rubrique=articles&id_art=1916 |title=Bilan des 18 ans Nationaux |date=22 May 2004 |access-date=22 March 2011 |publisher=OGC Nissa |language=fr}}</ref>

===Nice===
[[File:Hugo Lloris.JPG|thumb|upright|Lloris with [[OGC Nice|Nice]] in 2005]]

After success with the club's under-18 team, Lloris was promoted to the club's reserve team in the [[Championnat de France Amateur]], the fourth level of French football, for the 2004–05 season. He alternated the starting goalkeeper spot with Hilaire Munoz as he appeared in 12 matches.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.stat2foot.com/nopclubs/nice20405.htm |title=O.G.C.

He was designated by manager [[Frédéric Antonetti]] as the team's starting goalkeeper for the club's [[Coupe de la Ligue]] campaign ahead of fan-favourite (and fellow Nice native) [[Damien Gregorini]], who was relied more upon in league play. Lloris made his professional debut on 25 October 2005, at the age of 18, recording a clean sheet in Nice's 2–0 Coupe de la Ligue win over [[LB Châteauroux|Châteauroux]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/coupeLigue/feuille_match/50478 |archive-url= https://archive.today/20120711075823/http://new.lfp.fr/coupeLigue/feuille_match/50478 |url-status= dead |archive-date= 11 July 2012 |title=Nice v.

Lloris made his league debut on 18 March 2006 against Nancy picking up a [[clean sheet]] in a 1–0 victory.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/49927 |archive-url= https://archive.today/20120712074225/http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/49927 |url-status= dead |archive-date= 12 July 2012 |title=Nice v.

The [[2006–07 Ligue 1|following season]], Lloris was given the starting job permanently ahead of Gregorini, who subsequently departed the club for Nancy. Lloris appeared in all but one league match recording 13 clean sheets as Nice finished in 16th place. Despite the disappointing finish, the club was the fifth-best defensive team in the league with Lloris conceding only 36 goals. Only veterans [[Grégory Coupet]], [[Cédric Carrasso]] and [[Ulrich Ramé]] conceded fewer. For the early part of the [[2007–08 Ligue 1|2007–08 season]], Lloris endured a recurring ligament injury in his left knee, which forced him to miss three weeks in September. He returned to the team on 6 October 2007 in a league match against [[Le Mans FC|Le Mans]], but was substituted out after 71 minutes after the injury relapsed.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eurosport.fr/football/ligue-1/2007-2008/lloris-le-bout-du-tunnel_sto1387435/story.shtml |title=Lloris le bout du tunnel |date=24 November 2007 |access-date=18 July 2010 |publisher=Eurosport |language=fr}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/51340 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120712112513/http://new.lfp.fr/ligue1/feuille_match/51340 |url-status=dead |archive-date=12 July 2012 |title=Le Mans v.

Lloris conceded only 24 goals in his 30 appearances recording 13 clean sheets. He contributed to a defense that only conceded 30 overall during the season, tied for the league-best. Lloris' efforts that season led to him being approached by several big European clubs with hopes of signing him for the future.{{citation needed|date=February 2020}}

===Lyon===
====2008–09 season====
After another solid season with Nice, speculation arose as to where Lloris would play the following season. He was primarily linked to French club [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]], who wanted him to replace the departing Grégory Coupet, [[A.C. Milan|Milan]], who wanted him to replace the Brazilian [[Dida (footballer, born 1973)|Dida]], and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]], who wanted Lloris to replace [[Paul Robinson (footballer, born 1979)|Paul Robinson]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.soccernews.com/lyon-deny-coupet-rumours/2325/ |title=Lyon deny Coupet rumours |date=23 May 2008 |access-date=16 April 2010 |publisher=Soccer News}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.eyefootball.com/news/5681/Hugo-Lloris-to-AC-Milan/ |title=Hugo Lloris to AC Milan |date=19 May 2008 |access-date=16 April 2010 |publisher=Eye Football}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11095_3622045,00.html |title=Lloris open to Spurs talks |date=28 May 2008 |access-date=16 April 2010 |website=[[Sky Sports]]}}</ref> After reportedly coming to personal terms with Milan, Lloris snubbed the Italian club for seven-time [[Ligue 1]] champions Lyon.

Lloris was, subsequently, named the league's [[Trophées UNFP du football#Goalkeeper of the Year|top goalkeeper]] and also named to the [[Trophées UNFP du football#2009|Team of the Year]].

====2009–10 season====
[[File:Hugo Lloris 2010.jpg|160px|thumb|right|Lloris signing autographs in 2010]]

In the [[2009–10 Ligue 1|2009–10 season]], Lloris remained the club's first-choice goalkeeper and opened the new campaign by recording four clean sheets in the club's first eight matches. For his performances in the month of September, he was awarded the [[UNFP Player of the Month]] becoming the first goalkeeper since [[Steve Mandanda]] in August 2008 to receive the award. Lloris earned media praise for his performances against [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. In the first match, played at [[Anfield]], Lloris made four saves holding Liverpool to only one goal. Lyon won the match 2–1.

Lloris appeared in all five matches the team played in the competition. He made only five appearances with the [[France national under-21 football team|under-21 team]], primarily because of his commitments to the senior team. On 11 October 2008, with the under-21 squad attempting to qualify for the [[2009 UEFA European Under-21 Championship|2009 European Under-21 Championship]], coach [[Erick Mombaerts]] called up Lloris to the team for their important two-legged playoff against [[Germany national under-21 football team|Germany]], despite him having been called up to the senior team and the player having last played for the team in August 2007. Lloris honored the call up and started the second leg. With France seconds away from a spot in the tournament, because of the team's 1–1 draw in the first leg, Germany got a late goal from [[Benedikt Höwedes]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.fff.fr/servfff/fiche_joueur_new/match.php?id_match=41 |title=France v.
