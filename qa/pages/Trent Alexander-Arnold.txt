==Philanthropy==
Outside of football, Alexander-Arnold volunteers as an ambassador for the Liverpool-based charity ''An Hour for Others'', which seeks to provide underprivileged members of the community with anything from food hampers and toys to cooking and science lessons. He has supported the charity since being introduced to it by his mother in his mid-teens. During his time with Liverpool's academy, he and teammate Kris Owens pledged to support the initiative if either of them made it as professional footballers.<ref name=TG/> His philanthropy also expands beyond the charity and in March 2019, after signing a new boot sponsorship with [[Under Armour]] (the second most lucrative boot deal in England behind [[Harry Kane]]'s) he initiated plans to purchase plots in Liverpool and use the funds to construct new pitches for the community.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/trent-alexander-arnold-plans-pump-16008676 |title=Trent Alexander-Arnold plans to pump millions into Liverpool economy after signing lucrative Under Armour deal |newspaper=Liverpool Echo |last=Gors |first=Paul |date=21 March 2019 |access-date=21 March 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321164913/https://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/trent-alexander-arnold-plans-pump-16008676 |archive-date=21 March 2019 |url-status=live}}</ref>

In April 2023, he set up The After Academy, an initiative funded by Alexander-Arnold for the next five years that will support and aide former academy footballers.
