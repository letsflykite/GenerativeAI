The '''Indonesia 2022 FIFA World Cup bid''' was the first official bid from the [[Football Association of Indonesia]] (PSSI) to host the [[FIFA World Cup]]. [[FIFA]] rejected the bid for lack of government support on 19 March 2010.<ref name=reject/> Indonesia was one of four Asian countries bidding to bring the tournament to Asia for a second time, the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] tournament having been played in Japan and [[South Korea]]. Indonesia, under the name of the [[Dutch East Indies]], had been the first Asian nation to compete in the World Cup, when they participated in the [[1938 FIFA World Cup|1938 event]], and they lost to [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] in the first round.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/28/sports/28iht-soccup28.19753067.html?_r=1

The bid was launched at a time when there was pressure from Indonesian football fans to [[Nurdin Halid]] to step down from his position as the chairman of [[PSSI]]. The bid itself was used by [[Jusuf Kalla]] in his campaign to gain support for his presidential candidacy in 2009, though his effort was unsuccessful.

== Bid rejection ==
Indonesia was alone among the bidding nations in not having official government backing, although some support was offered in a 2009 interview by previous Youth and Sports Minister, [[Adhyaksa Dault]]. On 19 March 2010, FIFA announced that Indonesia's bid had been rejected, because required documents and guarantees had not been provided, as the government felt that the bid would not gain popular support in the country.<ref name=reject>{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/8577452.stm |title= Indonesia's bid to host the 2022 World Cup bid ends |date= 19 March 2010 |accessdate=19 March 2010 |work=BBC Sport}}</ref>
