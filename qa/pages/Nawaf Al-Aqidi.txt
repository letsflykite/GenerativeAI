===International===
====Saudi Arabia U23====
He played for the [[Saudi Arabia national under-20 football team|Saudi Arabia U20 national team]] but was not part of the [[2020 AFC U-19 Championship qualification]], in which Saudi Arabia qualified with two wins and one draw. However, with the [[2020 AFC U-19 Championship]] cancelled due to [[COVID-19 pandemic]], he was able to redeem himself in the [[2022 AFC U-23 Asian Cup]] with a spectacular performance, guiding the team to conquer the first title without conceding a single goal and a near perfect record with only [[Japan national under-23 football team|Japan]] managed to hold Saudi Arabia a draw.

He was also summoned for the [[Football at the 2021 Islamic Solidarity Games|Islamic Solidarity Games]] in [[Konya]], Turkey, which was delayed to 2022 due to the same reason. Al-Aqidi once again impressed in the tournament without conceding a single goal in the group stage until the semi-finals, when he finally conceded a goal after eight consecutive clean sheets, in Saudi Arabia's 2–1 win over [[Algeria national under-23 football team|Algeria]], albeit it was from a penalty rather than an open play. In the final, Al-Aqidi finally conceded the first ever open play goal after nine games, which was against the hosts [[Turkey national under-23 football team|Turkey]] in a pressuring attempt that saw [[Metehan Altunbaş]] netted, yet that goal proved disastrous as Saudi Arabia proved unable to break the Turkish defence as Saudi Arabia's hope to win the second major tournament in the same year crashed by this 0–1 loss.

====Senior====
On 18 November 2021, Al-Aqidi called up to the senior side for the first time to take part in the [[2021 FIFA Arab Cup]].<ref>{{cite web |title=23 لاعباً في قائمة المنتخب السعودي لبطولة كأس العرب |url=https://arabic.sport360.com/article/football/arabfootball/1104380/23-%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B9%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%8B-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A-%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B7%D9%88%D9%84%D8%A9-%D9%83%D8%A3%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A8}}</ref> He made no appearances in the competition, as Saudi Arabia exited at the group stage.

On 11 November 2022, Al-Aqidi was named in the squad for the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.saff.com.sa/en/news.php?id=1932 |title=Renard announces the national team list for the World Cup 2022 in Qatar |publisher=[[Saudi Arabian Football Federation]] |date=11 November 2022 |access-date=12 November 2022}}</ref> He didn't play a single game in the tournament as third choice keeper to [[Mohammed Al-Owais]] and [[Mohammed Al-Rubaie]], as Saudi Arabia again crashed out of the group stage despite historic win over [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] in the opener.

On 30 December 2022, Al-Aqidi was named in the squad for the [[25th Arabian Gulf Cup]].<ref>{{cite web |title=الشهري يعلن قائمة الأخضر المشاركة في كأس الخليج 25 بالبصرة |url=https://www.saff.com.sa/news.php?id=2002}}</ref> He started in all three matches, as Saudi Arabia again failed to progress from the group stage.
