==Style of play==

[[Horst Hrubesch]] has praised Kimmich for his versatility, saying "Joshua has enormous quality and is versatile in both attacking and defensive roles," also describing him as "an intelligent player with good technical skills and agility" and as "a winner." Remarking on Kimmich's versatility, a 2017 article on the Bundesliga's official website referred to him as a "veritable [[Swiss Army knife]] of a player", citing Guardiola's conversion of a player he once referred to as "one of the best defensive midfielder in the world" into a right-back.<ref>{{cite news|title=Germany's next golden generation|work=bundesliga.com|publisher=Bundesliga|access-date=16 March 2018|url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga-tv/goretzka-werner-kimmich-brandt-sule-germany-s-next-golden-generation-russia-2018-463688.jsp|date=8 November 2017|archive-date=17 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317035800/https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga-tv/goretzka-werner-kimmich-brandt-sule-germany-s-next-golden-generation-russia-2018-463688.jsp|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/bayern-munich/story/2500780/kimmich-eyes-bayern-role-of-man-united-target-schweinsteigerhttps://www.espn.com/soccer/bayern-munich/story/2500780/kimmich-eyes-bayern-role-of-man-united-target-schweinsteiger |title=Kimmich wants Schweini's role |work=ESPN.com |last1=Weber |first1=Jens |date=22 June 2015 |access-date=7 May 2021 }}</ref> He has also been used as a make-shift [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|centre-back]] on occasion,<ref name="icon">{{cite web |url=https://www.football-espana.net/2021/03/24/the-spanish-icon-bayern-munich-star-joshua-kimmich-modelled-his-game-on |title=The Spanish icon Bayern Munich star Joshua Kimmich modelled his game on |publisher=Football España |last1=Feehely |first1=Alan |language=en |date=24 March 2021 |access-date=11 August 2021 }}</ref> as a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]], or even as a [[Midfielder#Deep-lying playmaker (Strolling 10)|deep-lying playmaker]], due to his ability to dictate play in midfield.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/nagelsmann-planning-with-kimmich-in-central-midfield-at-bayern-munich-16504 |title=Julian Nagelsmann planning with Joshua Kimmich in central midfield at Bayern Munich |publisher=bundesliga.com |access-date=11 August 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2549649 |title=Dynamo Dresden vs. Bayern Munich: Things Learned from Club Friendly |publisher=Bleacher Report |last1=Bienkowski |first1=Stefan |date=17 August 2015 |access-date=11 August 2021 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.goal.com/it/news/3785/generazione-di-fenomeni/2016/02/23/20598192/profilo-joshua-kimmich-il-futuro-del-bayern-monaco-di |title=Profilo - Joshua Kimmich, il futuro del Bayern Monaco di Ancelotti |publisher=www.goal.com |language=Italian |last1=Marino |first1=Guido |date=23 February 2016 |access-date=11 August 2021 }}</ref> In 2015, Guardiola described Kimmich as a promising player, and noted that he "...has everything a player needs.

[[Amin Younes]] complimented Kimmich's defensive awareness as well in an interview, after the [[UEFA European Under-21 Championship|U21 EURO]] group stage. "Winning the ball back superbly. He does that really well", Younes told to the media. During the U21 competition, Philip Röber of [[UEFA]].com, described Kimmich's playing style on the website and compared him to [[İlkay Gündoğan]], but other critics compared him to retired Bayern captain [[Philipp Lahm]].<ref name="WK">{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/under21/news/newsid=2261411.html|title=UEFA.com's weekly wonderkid: Joshua Kimmich|website=[[UEFA]]|date=27 June 2015|access-date=14 December 2015|archive-date=29 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151229232930/http://www.uefa.com/under21/news/newsid=2261411.html|url-status=live}}</ref><blockquote>At Leipzig, he was part of an extremely attack-minded team in which his ball-winning qualities in front of a high back four shone through.
