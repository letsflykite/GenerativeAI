==Style of play==
Pedri usually plays in a free midfield role, which allows him to roam the pitch; he likes to occupy central areas and operate between the lines, although he is also capable of moving out wide and running towards the touchline to create chances for teammates. He even drops deep to the defence to pick up the ball. He normally situates himself on either the left or right flank, or even as a number 8.<ref name="50 migliori teenager"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.foottheball.com/rising-ballers/pedri-brings-back-iniesta-brilliance-to-barcelona/|title=Pedri - Player Profile and The Reason Why Barcelona Signed Him|website=FootTheBall|language=en-US|date=8 February 2021|access-date=9 February 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/54962709 |title=Could Pedri be 'skint' Barcelona's saviour? |work=BBC Sport |date=24 November 2020 |access-date=17 July 2021 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://sport.sky.it/calciomercato/2021/01/01/calciomercato-2021-talenti#25 |title=30 talenti da tenere d'occhio nel 2021 |website=sport.sky.it |language=it |date=1 January 2021 |access-date=17 July 2021 }}</ref> Indeed, although he initially played as a winger, he was later moved to a [[Midfielder#Central midfield|central midfield]] role, although he is also capable of playing as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]], as well as in several other [[Forward (association football)|offensive]] and [[Midfielder|midfield]] roles. He has also occasionally been used as a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfielder]] and even as a [[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|centre-forward]].

Pedri is considered a quick, intelligent, creative, and hard-working player, known for his excellent technical skills, ball control, passing, awareness, and vision, as well as his ability to manage himself in tight spaces, exploit gaps, and play the final ball or penetrating passes, making him an effective [[playmaker]].<ref name="PedriSwiss">{{cite web|date=1 July 2021|title=Euro 2020 Pedri González Spain|url=https://www.tsn.ca/pedri-indispensable-as-spain-bids-to-make-semis-at-euro-2020-1.1662550|access-date=17 July 2021|publisher=TSN}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/blog-espn-fc-united/story/4340555/haalandsanchofodenfati-lead-the-39-best-players-age-21-or-under |title=Who are the 39 best male players age 21 or under?
