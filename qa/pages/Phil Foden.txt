'''Philip Walter Foden''' (born 28 May 2000) is an English professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for {{English football updater|ManchesC}} club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and the [[England national football team|England national team]]. 

Foden's breakthrough into professional football came in 2017 when he won the [[FIFA U-17 World Cup#Awards|FIFA U-17 World Cup Golden Ball]] award following England's successful [[2017 FIFA U-17 World Cup|Under-17 World Cup]] campaign. He made his debut for City during the same year and in December was named [[BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year]].<ref>{{cite news|title=BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year 2017: Footballer Phil Foden wins|work=BBC Sport|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/sports-personality/42336966|access-date=3 June 2022|url-status=live|archive-date=3 June 2022|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220603075850/https://www.bbc.com/sport/sports-personality/42336966}}</ref>

Foden has since made over 200 appearances for the club, winning fourteen honours including a [[Treble (association football)|continental treble]] in [[2022–23 Manchester City F.C. season|2022–23]] and becoming the youngest recipient of a [[List of Premier League winning players|Premier League winner's medal]] in 2018.<ref>{{cite web |title=Man City fans loved seeing Phil Foden make Premier League history |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-city-foden-diaz-medal-14652426 |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |date=13 May 2018 |access-date=22 April 2019 |archive-date=14 May 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180514213843/https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/man-city-foden-diaz-medal-14652426 |url-status=live }}</ref> In 2019, he won a second Premier League and became the club's youngest-ever goalscorer in the [[UEFA Champions League]], and is the youngest English player to both start a match and score in the knockout stages of the competition. In 2021, he was named as the [[Premier League Young Player of the Season]] and the [[PFA Young Player of the Year]].

Foden has represented England at many youth levels, scoring 19 goals in 51 youth caps. He was first called up to the senior team on 25 August 2020 and made his debut against [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] on 5 September 2020, in a 1–0 [[UEFA Nations League]] victory.
