'''Dragan Stojković''' ({{lang-sr-Cyrl|Драган Стојковић}}, {{IPA-sh|drǎɡan stǒːjkoʋitɕ|pron}}; born 3 March 1965), also known by the nickname '''Piksi''' (Пикси), is a Serbian [[Association football|football]] manager and former player who played as a [[midfielder]]. He is the current [[manager (association football)|manager]] of the [[Serbia national football team|Serbia national team]]. Stojković was a long time captain of the Yugoslavia national team and [[Red Star Belgrade]],<ref>[http://www.redstarbelgrade.com/content.aspx?cultureID=2&ID=766&sectionID=24 Piksi] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221010053/http://www.redstarbelgrade.com/content.aspx?cultureID=2&ID=766&sectionID=24 |date=21 December 2008 }} on Red Star official web site</ref> and is considered one of the greatest of all-time in Yugoslav and Serbian football.

He was a star player for Yugoslavia at the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] (where he was selected for the [[FIFA World Cup awards#All-Star Team|World Cup All-Star Team]]) and [[1998 FIFA World Cup]]s, serving as captain at the latter.

He is one of only five players to be awarded the "[[Red Star Belgrade#Stars of Red Star|Star of the Red Star]]" and is widely considered to have never shown his true potential in Europe,<ref>http://outsideoftheboot.com/2013/05/17/dragan-stojkovic-one-of-the-greatest/ {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191017200801/http://outsideoftheboot.com/2013/05/17/dragan-stojkovic-one-of-the-greatest/ |date=17 October 2019 }} Outside of the Boot: Dragan Stojkovic, one of the Greatest – By Uros Popovic. 17 May 2013</ref> as injury prevented him from establishing himself at Marseille over the long term.

==Early life==
Born to father Dobrivoje and mother Desanka in [[Niš]], [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|SR Serbia]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|SFR Yugoslavia]], Stojković took to football very early while growing up in the [[Pasi Poljana]] community near Niš.<ref>[https://www.ilustrovana.com/legende-naseg-fudbaladragan-stojkovic/?sr_pismo=lat Legende našeg fudbala: Dragan Stojković]</ref> He was nicknamed '''Piksi''' after ''Pixie'', one of the characters from the cartoon ''[[Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks]]''.<ref>[http://www.glassrbije.org/sport/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=186:dragan-stojkovi-piksi&catid=47:legende&Itemid=67 Dragan Stojković Piksi]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090313150946/http://www.glassrbije.org/sport/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=186%3Adragan-stojkovi-piksi&catid=47%3Alegende&Itemid=67 |date=13 March 2009 }} {{in lang|sr}}</ref>
In addition to his native [[Serbian language|Serbian]], Stojković also speaks [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and some [[Japanese language|Japanese]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Football in China: Foreign recruits equate language interpreters to 'wives' |url=https://www.newindianexpress.com/sport/football/2019/oct/30/football-in-china-foreign-recruits-equate-language-interpreters-to-wives-2054671.html |website=The New Indian Express |access-date=6 August 2020}}</ref>

===Youth football===
Playing in the [[FK Radnički Niš]] youth system, in summer 1979, fourteen-year-old Stojković's talent was already evident as he was attached to the [[Vladica Kovačević]]-coached [[FK Partizan]] under-16 team as a temporary addition to the squad for the duration of a tournament in [[Quimper]], [[France]].<ref name="alo">{{cite web | last = Topalović | first = Miloš | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tz2VeZ_5DW4&t=90s | title = Dragan Stojković Piksi: Moj prvi dolazak u Beograd i let avionom bio je zahvaljujući Partizanu (timestamp 1:30) | archive-url = https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/Tz2VeZ_5DW4 | archive-date = 7 April 2022 | language = sr | publisher = [[Alo!]] | date = 1 May 2021 | access-date = 3 June 2021 | url-status = live }}</ref> Flown to Belgrade and then to France for the occasion, the trip marked a series of firsts for the youngster: his very first time in the Yugoslav capital [[Belgrade]], first time travelling abroad, and his first time on an airplane.<ref name="alo"/>

Upon returning to Radnički, Stojković was again attached to the FK Partizan youth squad the following summer, 1980, for youth tournaments in the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coastal towns of [[Senigallia]] and [[Falconara Marittima]].<ref name="alo"/>

==Club career==
===Radnički Niš===
A midfielder and occasional [[Striker (association football)|forward]], Stojković began his professional playing career with [[Yugoslav First League]] and hometown side [[Radnički Niš]]. His full squad debut took place at age seventeen under head coach [[Dušan Nenković]] during the 1981-82 season in the form of a substitute [[1981–82 Yugoslav First League|league]] appearance on 4 April 1982 away at [[FK Vardar]]. It was the young player's only full squad appearance of the season and it took place just a few days before Radnički's famous [[1981–82 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] [[1981–82 UEFA Cup#Semi-finals|semifinal]] tie versus [[1981–82 Hamburger SV season|Hamburger SV]], the Niš club's greatest success.<ref>{{cite web | last = Petrović | first = Nebojša | url = https://mondo.rs/Sport/Fudbal/a1619611/Radnicki-Nis-40-godina-od-meca-sa-HSV.html | title = Piksi je "najveći krivac" što Radnički nije osvojio Kup UEFA: 40 godina od istorije južne pruge - To je neponovljivo! | language = sr | publisher = Mondo.rs | date = 7 April 2022 | access-date = 7 April 2022}}</ref>

Over the following four seasons, Stojković appeared in 70 matches for Radnički, scoring eight goals.

===Red Star Belgrade===
In the summer of 1986, twenty-one-year-old Stojković moved to Red Star Belgrade where he would spend the next four seasons, scoring 54 times in 120 appearances. {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

By the 1989-90 season, Stojković became a transfer target for some of the biggest and richest European clubs of the day. Juventus representatives were the first to approach the player as well as Red Star. However, any possibility of a deal soon fell through due to Stojković's reported skepticism about his playing opportunities in [[Turin]] due to the UEFA-enforced three-foreigners matchday squad rule and the ''bianconeri'' already having three foreigners in their [[Dino Zoff]]-coached [[1989–90 Juventus F.C. season|team]]—Soviets [[Sergei Aleinikov]] and [[Oleksandr Zavarov]] as well as Portuguese [[Rui Barros]].<ref name="gazzetta">{{cite web | last = Petrović | first = Nebojša | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ucoMaay6xsQ&t=1097s | title = "...suze mi idu koliko me boli, a Faruk kaže 'moraš majstore'..."

One of his most famous goals was scored in the derby against Partizan Belgrade from a corner kick.

===Marseille===
In the summer of 1990, twenty-five-year-old Stojković made the much publicized move to [[Olympique de Marseille]] for a transfer fee of [[Pound sterling|£]]5.5 million, joining the star-laden squad bankrolled by French businessman/politician [[Bernard Tapie]]. The expectations were sky-high with a team featuring world-class players such as [[Jean-Pierre Papin]], [[Éric Cantona]], [[Chris Waddle]], [[Carlos Mozer]], [[Manuel Amoros]], [[Didier Deschamps]], [[Jean Tigana]], [[Abédi Pelé]], as well as newly arrived defender [[Basile Boli]] and new head coach [[Franz Beckenbauer]] fresh off winning the 1990 FIFA World Cup with West Germany. Stojković had his own shining moments at the same World Cup, all of which contributed further to Marseille's interest.

Early into his [[1990–91 Olympique de Marseille season|debut season]], Stojković sustained a knee injury for which he had to have surgery in Germany, forcing him to the sidelines for months. In fact, the entire 1990–91 league season was injury riddled for the Serb and he ended up making only eleven league appearances. Beckenbauer stepped down from the coaching post during the winter break, although he remained with the club in an adviser capacity. The new head coach to replace the famous German was [[Raymond Goethals]]. In the [[1991 European Cup Final|final]] of the UEFA European Champions' Cup, Marseille played against Stojković's former team Red Star. Stojković, a penalty kick specialist, entered the game late during the extra-time as a substitute, but as the match eventually went to a penalty shootout, he informed head coach Goethals that he did not want to take a penalty shot against his former team. Red Star won the European Cup in the shootout.<ref name="Belgrade fog">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/24573761 |title=How Milan's success was 'born in Belgrade fog' |work=BBC Sport |last1=Rostance |first1=Tom |date=5 November 2013 |access-date=19 December 2020 }}</ref>

He subsequently transferred to [[Hellas Verona]] in Italy in the summer of 1991, for ten billion lira. The team had won the scudetto just six years before, but after some financial problems had just been promoted back to serie A after one year in the Italian second league. Stojkovic had an unlucky season, plagued by injuries and disciplinary troubles, and was sold back to [[Marseille]] where he remained for two more seasons, which meant he finally won a Champions league winner medal in [[1992–93 UEFA Champions League|1992–93]],<ref name="Belgrade fog"/>. However, he was unlucky to miss the final because of injury. 

===Nagoya Grampus Eight===
In the spring of 1994, Stojković signed with Japanese [[J-League]] team [[Nagoya Grampus Eight]], joining a [[1994 Nagoya Grampus Eight season|squad]] managed by [[Gordon Milne]] and featuring [[Gary Lineker]].

He spent seven seasons with Grampus Eight, retiring as a player in 2001. Stojković played 183 matches for the club, scoring 57 times. He was named J-League MVP for the 1995 season. Since then, he has gained huge popularity among Japanese supporters, most notably among Nagoya Grampus fans, due to his skillful display, which followed him even after his retirement.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/sports/2008/03/04/soccer/j-league/stojkovic-delighted-to-be-back-in-nagoya/|title = Stojkovic delighted to be back in Nagoya|date = 4 March 2008}}</ref> Fans commemorated him by chanting "Ale Piksi" whenever he scored a goal.

==International career==

===Youth level===
Stojković made his [[Yugoslavia national under-21 football team|under-21]] debut on 11 October 1983 versus Norway in [[Pančevo]] as part of qualifying for the [[1984 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]]. Playing under head coach [[Ivan Toplak]], the youngster from Radnički Niš scored on his debut as Yugoslavia won 6–2.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NVpp7mCz-bM Yugoslavia-Norway 6:2];1984 Euro qualifying, 11 October 1983</ref>

===Senior team===
Stojković made 84 career international appearances, scoring 15 times, those split between the [[Yugoslavia national football team|SFR Yugoslavia national team]] and the [[Serbia and Montenegro national football team|FR Yugoslavia national team]]. He played for the former in [[UEFA Euro 1984]], [[Football at the 1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Summer Olympics]], [[Football at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988 Summer Olympics]] and the 1990 FIFA World Cup and for the latter in the 1998 FIFA World Cup and [[UEFA Euro 2000]]. He made his international debut on 12 November 1983 in a scoreless draw against [[France national football team|France]].

At the 1990 World Cup, Stojković scored both goals in Yugoslavia's 2–1 round-of-16 defeat of [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in [[Verona]]. In the quarter-final, he was one of three Yugoslavs to miss in the 3–2 [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] defeat to world champions [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/soccer/world-cup-2010/writers/jonathan_wilson/07/01/yugoslavia.1990/|title=Osim recalls what might have been for a brilliant Yugoslavia in 1990|date=1 July 2010|access-date=18 June 2014|work=Sports Illustrated}}</ref>

He was later called to [[UEFA Euro 1992]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hemeroteca.mundodeportivo.com/preview/1992/05/27/pagina-27/1245648/pdf.html|website=[[Mundo Deportivo]]|title=Pancev también renuncia a la Eurocopa|language=es|date=25 May 1992|access-date=5 June 2019}}</ref> but the nation would be suspended due to the [[Yugoslav Wars]]. After being part of team in [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000]], his final international match was against the country he spent much of his playing career in, [[Japan national football team|Japan]], on 4 July 2001.

==Style of play==
A highly skilful [[Midfielder|midfield]] [[playmaker]], Stojković is considered to be one of the greatest players ever to come out of former Yugoslavia; he was also capable of playing as an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]], as a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]], or as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]], and was even used as a ''[[Forward (association football)#Centre-forward|target–man]]'' on occasion. A quick, opportunistic, and unpredictable player, he was known in particular for his vision, creativity, and passing ability, as well as his excellent technique and [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] skills, which enabled him to beat several opponents, and earned him the nickname "the [[Diego Maradona|Maradona]] of the [[Balkans]]."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/may/27/100-top-world-cup-footballers-100-61|title=100 top World Cup footballers: No100 to No61|work=The Guardian|date=27 May 2014|access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://sport.tiscali.it/calcio/articoli/gol-cos-dragan-stojkovic-carriera-non-ha-mai-fatto/ |title=Un gol così?

==Administrative career==
===FA president===
Upon retiring in 2001, 36-year-old Stojković immediately became the Serbian Football Association president, succeeding [[Miljan Miljanić]].

During that period he was elected as a member of the UEFA technical committee and member of FIFA football committee for an 8-year term.

===Red Star Belgrade president===
In July 2005, Stojković became the president of Red Star Belgrade. Similar to his FA appointment four years earlier, Stojković again became a successor to another tenured, larger than life figure in Serbian football, [[Dragan Džajić]], who had occupied various leading posts within the club's management over the preceding 26 years. The transfer of power was full of controversy with plenty of lobbying behind the scenes and at times open feuding in the press.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

====2005–06 season====
One of Stojković's first orders of business ahead of the [[2005–06 Red Star Belgrade season|2005–06 season]] was firing the head coach he inherited, [[Ratko Dostanić]], and bringing [[Walter Zenga]] who thus became the first foreigner ever to [[List of Red Star Belgrade football coaches|coach Red Star]]. Calling on his Japan connections, Stojković also got [[Toyota|Toyota Motor Corporation]] to invest in the club through a shirt sponsorship deal. Additionally, he also opened the club's doors to various prominent Serbian companies like [[Delta Holding]] and [[Telekom Srbija]] thus creating a pool of sponsors.

On the player personnel front, Stojković initially more-or-less continued the existing "buy low sell high" policy that meant players were mostly recruited from Red Star's own youth system or smaller clubs throughout Serbia and Montenegro, and then sold abroad as soon as they gained some exposure on the European scene. Stojković's most prominent initial move was loaning out striker [[Marko Pantelić]] to [[Hertha Berlin]] for €250,000 on the last day of the summer 2005 transfer window (Pantelić would eventually be sold to Hertha for additional €1.5 million in April 2006). On the other hand, 20-year-old striker [[Milan Purović]] and 22-year-old keeper [[Vladimir Stojković]] were brought to the club from [[FK Budućnost Podgorica|Budućnost Podgorica]] and [[FK Zemun]], respectively. Additionally, by bringing in Ghanaian midfielder [[Haminu Dramani]], president Stojković indicated he was also interested in affordable foreign imports, which would soon become a staple of his transfer policy. All three new arrivals gelled well with the existing squad (featuring the likes of [[Nikola Žigić]], [[Boško Janković]], [[Milan Biševac]], [[Dušan Basta]], [[Nenad Kovačević]], [[Aleksandar Luković]], and [[Milan Dudić]]), as Red Star jumped out to a lead in the [[2005–06 Serbia and Montenegro SuperLiga|league]], including a 2–0 home win against the [[Eternal derby (Serbia)|cross-town rivals]] [[2005–06 FK Partizan season|FK Partizan]] in mid-October 2005.

Simultaneously, the club also played some inspired football in the [[UEFA Cup 2005-06|UEFA Cup]]—including a [[2005–06 UEFA Cup group stage#Red Star Belgrade v Roma|notable 3–1 home win]] versus [[2005–06 A.S. Roma season|A.S. Roma]]—before being prevented from progressing to the eight-finals stage during the [[2005–06 UEFA Cup#Group E|group]]'s [[2005–06 UEFA Cup group stage#Strasbourg v Red Star Belgrade|last matchday]] away at [[RC Strasbourg]] via a goal by [[Kevin Gameiro]] deep into injury time.

The squad was further strengthened during the 2005-06 winter transfer window, especially the spots upfront, with the arrivals of attacking midfielder [[Igor Burzanović]] from Budućnost Podgorica, Japanese forward [[Takayuki Suzuki]], midfielder [[Nenad Milijaš]] from FK Zemun, and striker [[Dušan Đokić]] from [[FK Voždovac]]. Red Star comfortably won the league-[[2005–06 Serbia and Montenegro Cup|cup]] double, losing only two league matches during the season.

====2006–07 season====
Winning the double combined with some fine European outings during the previous season raised the fans' expectations considerably as they now wanted the existing Red Star squad kept intact (especially Nikola Žigić who had reportedly already become a transfer target for some high-profile English Premiership clubs) in order to make a serious run at qualifying for the [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage. However, the first move came as a complete shock—president Stojković sold goalkeeper Vladimir Stojković to [[FC Nantes]], reportedly for €3 million. Trying to deal with the angry fan reaction, he attempted to explain the move as being necessitated by the club's accumulated debts that had reportedly grown to alarming levels following "years of mismanagement and unpaid commitments of some of the key sponsor pool members".<ref>[http://www.b92.net/sport/fudbal/vesti.php?yyyy=2006&mm=05&dd=15&nav_id=197693 Dragan Stojković: "Morali smo..."]</ref> With head coach Zenga departing, Stojković hired celebrated coach [[Dušan Bajević]] who thus returned to Serbian/ex-Yugoslav football after almost two decades of coaching in Greece with great success. The transfers out of the club continued with Milan Dudić sold to [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]], Haminu Dramani to [[Gençlerbirliği S.K.|Gençlerbirliği]], and Aleksandar Luković to [[2006–07 Udinese Calcio season|Udinese]], however, their departures caused comparatively less angry fan reaction. Preparing for Champions League qualifying, players brought in by president Stojković were twenty-four-year-old Bulgarian international attacking midfielder [[Blagoy Georgiev]], Brazilian forward [[Ely Thadeu]], and Senegalese defender [[Ibrahima Gueye (footballer, born 1978)|Ibrahima Gueye]].

Red Star easily eliminated Irish champions Cork City at the start of Champions League qualifying, however, getting drawn against [[Carlo Ancelotti]]'s powerhouse [[2006–07 A.C. Milan season|AC Milan]] featuring [[Kaká]], [[Andrea Pirlo]], [[Clarence Seedorf]], [[Cafu]], [[Gennaro Gattuso]], [[Filippo Inzaghi|Pippo Inzaghi]], [[Alessandro Costacurta|Billy Costacurta]], etc. in the next qualifying round proved too difficult to overcome, as the Belgrade club lost 1–3 on aggregate. Failure to reach the Champions League group stage prompted another round of transfers out of the club with captain Nenad Kovačević sold to [[2006–07 RC Lens season|RC Lens]], Boško Janković to [[RCD Mallorca]], and finally the club's most prized asset Nikola Žigić to [[Racing Santander]] while Milan Biševac's future transfer to Lens effective 2006-07 winter transfer window was already agreed upon in advance.

On the other hand, Ecuadorian defensive midfielder [[Segundo Castillo (footballer, born 1982)|Segundo Castillo]] joined the club towards the end of the transfer window. Finally, on the last day of the summer 2006 transfer window Stojković brought in the club's most prominent foreign acquisition to date and since, thirty-three-year-old [[Aílton (footballer, born 1973)|Aílton]] who had been the Bundesliga top scorer only two years prior.

On 12 October 2007 Stojković announced that he was stepping down as the president of Red Star Belgrade.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vrakela|first=S.|url=https://sportal.blic.rs/fudbal/domaci-fudbal/piksi-udario-sam-u-zid/2022042907361728391|title=Piksi: Udario sam u zid|agency=[[Blic]]|date=13 October 2007|access-date=29 May 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.danas.rs/sport/stojkovic-napustio-zvezdu/|title=Stojković napustio Zvezdu|agency=[[Danas (newspaper)|Danas]]|date=13 October 2007|access-date=29 May 2022}}</ref>

In April 2009, at a press conference announcing the club's current debt to be [[€]]22.3 million, Red Star Belgrade general secretary Saša Kozić (subordinate to club president [[Dan Tana]]) accused the former club president Stojković of "running the club irresponsibly, to say the least".<ref name="kozic-2009">{{cite news|url=https://www.b92.net/sport/fudbal/vesti.php?yyyy=2009&mm=04&dd=16&nav_id=355891|title=Zvezda duguje 22,3 miliona evra|agency=[[B92]].net|date=16 April 2009|access-date=5 June 2022}}</ref> Kozić—who had much like the current president Tana been part of the club's managing board during Stojković's 2005-2007 club presidency—added that Red Star's operating expenses had increased significantly under Stojković to €1.5–2 million per month, including the salaries of club officials doubling during 2007 as well as promotional expenses (normally at €100,000) ballooning to €1.1 million over the two-year period.<ref name="kozic-2009"/> He added that in total the club had spent almost €50 million during Stojković's two-year presidency; funds obtained either through bank loans or from player sales.<ref name="kozic-2009"/>

Responding to Kozić's accusations, Nagoya head coach Stojković "rejected them categorically", claiming his physical absence from Serbia is being used as "cover-up for Red Star's bad business results".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.b92.net/sport/fudbal/vesti.php?yyyy=2009&mm=04&dd=18&nav_id=356222|title=Stojković: "Besmislene optužbe!"|agency=[[B92]].net|date=18 April 2009|access-date=5 June 2022}}</ref>

Despite his status as the club's playing legend as well as its official ''[[Red Star Belgrade#Stars of Red Star|fifth star]]'', ever since his 2007 resignation from the post of Red Star president, Stojković has had a contentious relationship with a section of the club's ultras, [[Delije]], who blame him for "jumping ship and leaving a financial mess behind".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraf.rs/sport/fudbal/3504408-zasto-delije-mrze-dragana-stojkovica-piksija|title=Zašto Delije mrze Piksija? Sukob počeo pre 15 godina, kulminirao pre 10 na Marakani|agency=Telegraf.rs|date=27 May 2022|access-date=29 May 2022}}</ref>

The situation has flared up on several occasions over the years since.

In January 2012, while having coffee at a Red Star Belgrade licensed and operated cafe within the club's [[Marakana]] stadium, Nagoya head coach Stojković—in town for the funeral of [[Miljan Miljanić]]—was forced to leave his old club's premises by a group of three Delije following an uncomfortable verbal exchange during which the club's former president was reportedly told he's "not welcome".<ref>{{cite news|last=C.|first=I.|url=https://www.politika.rs/sr/clanak/204856/Specijalni-dodaci/Dragan-Stojkovic-nepozeljan-na-Zvezdinom-stadionu-Lukic-u-soku|title=Dragan Stojković nepoželjan na Zvezdinom stadionu – Lukić u šoku|agency=[[Politika]]|date=17 January 2012|access-date=29 May 2022}}</ref><ref name="B92-piksi-oteran">{{cite news|url=https://www.b92.net/sport/fudbal/vesti.php?yyyy=2012&mm=01&dd=17&nav_id=574450|title=Delije oterale Piksija sa Marakane|agency=[[B92]].net|date=17 January 2012|access-date=29 May 2022}}</ref> The incident led to club's current president [[Vladan Lukić]] expressing "shock and dismay" and announcing personal intention of inviting Stojković for a cup of coffee in his office, stating "the club's doors are always open to him" while adding that "it's superfluous to explain what Dragan Stojković means to this club".<ref>{{cite news|last=Mitrović|first=Danilo|url=https://www.vijesti.me/sport/fudbal/332363/lukic-sokiran-izbacivanjem-piksija-marakana-je-njegova-kuca|title=Lukić šokiran izbacivanjem Piksija: Marakana je njegova kuća!|agency=[[Vijesti]]|date=17 January 2012|access-date=29 May 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nezavisne.com/sport/fudbal/Lukic-Piksi-za-tebe-su-vrata-Marakane-uvek-otvorena/124008|title=Lukić: Piksi, za tebe su vrata Marakane uvek otvorena|agency=[[Nezavisne novine]]|date=17 January 2012|access-date=29 May 2022}}</ref>

Stojković, for his part, mostly shrugged off the incident as "three young men, one of whom I recognized as the ultra fan group leader back from my [club presidential] tenure, walking up to me and telling me they're not permitting me to be there" while further dismissing their action as being motivated by "dislike of me because I had had a clear code of conduct that excluded them [club's ultra fans] from influencing club policy and prevented them from enjoying certain [financial] benefits".<ref name="B92-piksi-oteran"/> Within days, Delije put out a press release asking Stojković for detailed explanation of club's finances during his presidential tenure, specifically posing a question to him "how's it possible to take over a club with debts of [[€]]5 million and then depart two years later, leaving the same club with €20 million in debts while simultaneously over the same period receiving €40 million worth of transfer fees for sold players".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.b92.net/sport/fudbal/vesti.php?yyyy=2012&mm=01&dd=20&nav_id=575721|title=Delije: "Piksi, odakle dug?"|agency=[[B92]].net|date=20 January 2012|access-date=30 May 2022}}</ref>

In November 2012—amidst Red Star's 2008-2009 club president [[Dan Tana]]'s announcement of writing-off the [[€]]600,000 that the entrepreneur had reportedly given the cash-strapped club out of his own pocket during his club presidency<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraf.rs/sport/426787-den-tana-oprosticu-zvezdi-deo-duga|title=Den Tana: Oprostiću Zvezdi deo duga|agency=Telegraf.rs|date=22 November 2012|access-date=5 June 2022}}</ref>—Stojković too announced he's willing to forget the €32,000 the club had reportedly owed him due to Stojković reportedly paying the amount out of his own pocket for the players' hotel stay during the club's away trip to [[Milan]].<ref name="piksi-oprost-dugova-2012">{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraf.rs/sport/427600-zvezda-i-piksi-posle-den-tane-oprasta-dugove|title=Zvezda: I Piksi posle Den Tane oprašta dugove|agency=Telegraf.rs|date=22 November 2012|access-date=5 June 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=G.|last=A.|url=http://arhiva.alo.rs/sport/fudbal/hvala-piksiju-ali-to-ne-znaci-da-nece-odgovarati/5013|title=Hvala Piksiju, ali to ne znači da neće odgovarati!|agency=[[Alo!]]|date=23 November 2012|access-date=5 June 2022}}</ref> Stojković reportedly decided to forgive the club's debt to him after previously refusing to do so when asked to during Vladan Lukić's club presidency.<ref name="piksi-oprost-dugova-2012"/>

The antagonism between Delije and Stojković reignited again in late May 2022, more than 10 years after the initial 2012 cafe incident, when Stojković—now Serbia national team head coach—came to the Marakana to watch the [[2021–22 Serbian Cup|Serbian Cup]] [[2021–22 Serbian Cup#Final|final]]. Knowing he'll be at the match in person, some of the Delije unfurled a sizable banner calling Stojković out again over his 2005-2007 time as club president, claiming it set up a "decade-long calamity for the club".<ref>{{cite news|last=Vujičić|first=Milutin|url=https://mondo.rs/Sport/Fudbal/a1640861/Poruka-Delija-za-Dragana-Stojkovica-Piksija.html|title="SAJONARA!"

==Managerial career==
===Nagoya Grampus===
Stojković returned to Japan to take over as manager of his former club, Nagoya Grampus, on 22 January 2008. On 15 March 2008 the former J.League MVP won his first game as manager as Nagoya Grampus stunned [[AFC Champions League 2007]] Champions [[Urawa Reds]] 2–0 at Urawa's home, the [[Saitama Stadium]]. Despite his glorious playing career at Nagoya, some Nagoya fans were initially worried about his lack of experience as a coach; however, his team finished in 3rd place and he led the club to [[AFC Champions League]] for the first time in his debut season.

In a 2009 J.League match between [[Yokohama F. Marinos]] and Nagoya Grampus, Stojković amazed everyone by scoring a goal from his [[technical area]]. One of the players had just been injured, so the goalkeeper [[Tetsuya Enomoto]] kicked the ball out of play to stop the game. Stojković got out of his seat in the dugout and volleyed the ball, which went high into the air before dipping into goal.<ref>Archived at [https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211205/XQPR43v64e4 Ghostarchive]{{cbignore}} and the [https://web.archive.org/web/20091204021622/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQPR43v64e4 Wayback Machine]{{cbignore}}: {{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XQPR43v64e4| title = Amazing Goal by Manager!!!

On 20 November 2010, Stojković led Grampus to the J. League title, the club's very first. Stojković has stated that he had learnt a lot about football from former manager [[Arsène Wenger]], who had led the club to their previous best showing in 1995 when they finished runners-up and Emperor's Cup champions, and had kept regular contact with him, with Wenger giving him advice and congratulating him on the club's success.
