==Early life==
Koulibaly was born on 20 June 1991 to Senegalese parents in [[Saint-Dié-des-Vosges]], France.<ref name="Koulibaly Players’ Tribune"/> His father worked in a textile mill in Senegal for seven days a week and never took weekends off for five years before he saved enough money to take his mother to France.<ref name="Koulibaly Players’ Tribune"/> He grew up in Saint-Dié-des-Vosges, revealing that: "When you grow up in this environment, you see everyone as your brother. We are black, white, Arab, African, Muslim, Christian, yes — but we are all French. We are all hungry, so let’s go have a Turkish meal together. Or tonight, let’s all go to my house and eat Senegalese food. Yes, we have differences, but we are all equal."<ref name="Koulibaly Players’ Tribune"/> Koulibaly says his upbringing was "heavily influenced by the multi-cultural nature" growing up.<ref name="Koulibaly BBC Sport"/>

Koulibaly revealed that he first started playing football, saying: "All the kids were running around playing football with no shoes, and I was really upset by this, I guess. My mom says that I was begging her to go to the store and buy shoes for everybody, so I could play football with them. But my mother said, “Kalidou, just take your shoes off. Go play like they do.” In the end, I threw off my shoes and went to play barefoot with my cousins — and this is where my football story begins. When we got back to France, I was playing every day in the little park by our house."<ref name="Koulibaly Players’ Tribune"/> His footballing career began with local club [[SR Saint-Dié]].<ref name="Koulibaly Contract"/> He then joined FC Metz in his first spell but was subsequently released at fifteen, which according to the club's Academy Manager, Denis Schaeffer, Koulibaly was let go "because he was too introverted, and his level was a little below our expectations."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fcmetz.com/2011-2012/actualites/club/chance-fait-escale-metz|title=THE CHANCE A FAIT ESCALE À METZ|publisher=FC Metz|language=fr|date=14 April 2012|access-date=6 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606173409/https://www.fcmetz.com/2011-2012/actualites/club/chance-fait-escale-metz|archive-date=6 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Club career==
===Early career===
Koulibaly began his career playing for his hometown club SR Saint-Dié's youth team; he spent two seasons playing for the club's team in the [[Championnat de France Amateur 2]], before joining the youth academy of professional club [[FC Metz|Metz]] on 1 July 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.republicain-lorrain.fr/fr/permalien/article/4072101/Koulibaly-le-jour-d-apres.html|work=Le Républicain Lorrain|title=Koulibaly, le jour d'après|language=fr|date=2 November 2010|access-date=15 December 2010|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230154008/http://www.republicain-lorrain.fr/fr/permalien/article/4072101/Koulibaly-le-jour-d-apres.html|archive-date=30 December 2010}}</ref> While at Metz, Koulibaly helped the club's under-19 team win the [[2009–10 Coupe Gambardella]] after the team defeated [[FC Sochaux-Montbéliard|Sochaux]] 5–4 on penalties in the [[2010 Coupe Gambardella Final|final]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fff.fr/compint/65427/match/65434.shtml|publisher=French Football Federation|title=Sochaux v.

===Metz===
Prior to the start of the [[2010–11 Ligue 2|2010–11 season]], Koulibaly signed his first professional contract agreeing to a one-year deal.

He appeared as a substitute in a 1–0 victory.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fcmetz.com/2010-2011/actualites/equipe-pro/metz-respire-enfin|title=METZ RESPIRE ENFIN|publisher=FC Metz|language=fr|date=20 August 2010|access-date=6 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606173610/https://www.fcmetz.com/2010-2011/actualites/equipe-pro/metz-respire-enfin|archive-date=6 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Following this, Koulibaly became a first team regular for the side after dispatching the place from [[Nuno Frechaut]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fcmetz.com/2010-2011/actualites/equipe-pro/metz-face-un-gros-morceau|title=METZ FACE À UN GROS MORCEAU|publisher=FC Metz|language=fr|date=4 November 2010|access-date=6 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606173607/https://www.fcmetz.com/2010-2011/actualites/equipe-pro/metz-face-un-gros-morceau|archive-date=6 June 2019|url-status=live}}<br>{{cite web|url=https://www.fcmetz.com/2010-2011/actualites/equipe-pro/je-mesure-ma-chance|title=" JE MESURE MA CHANCE|publisher=FC Metz|language=fr|date=29 March 2011|access-date=6 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606173236/https://www.fcmetz.com/2010-2011/actualites/equipe-pro/je-mesure-ma-chance|archive-date=6 June 2019|url-status=live}}<br>{{cite web|url=https://www.fcmetz.com/2010-2011/actualites/equipe-pro/sommet-inverse|title=SOMMET INVERSÉ|publisher=FC Metz|language=fr|date=31 March 2011|access-date=6 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606173356/https://www.fcmetz.com/2010-2011/actualites/equipe-pro/sommet-inverse|archive-date=6 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> On 15 April 2011, he scored his first goal for FC Metz, as they drew 3–3 against [[Clermont Foot|Clermont]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fcmetz.com/2010-2011/actualites/equipe-pro/deboussolant|title=DÉBOUSSOLANT!|publisher=FC Metz|language=fr|date=15 April 2011|access-date=6 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606173601/https://www.fcmetz.com/2010-2011/actualites/equipe-pro/deboussolant|archive-date=6 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> Three days later, Koulibaly signed a three–year contract extension with the club, keeping him until 2014.<ref name="Koulibaly Contract">{{cite web|url=https://www.fcmetz.com/2010-2011/actualites/club/koulibaly-signe-trois-ans|title=KOULIBALY SIGNE TROIS ANS|publisher=FC Metz|language=fr|date=18 April 2011|access-date=6 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606173210/https://www.fcmetz.com/2010-2011/actualites/club/koulibaly-signe-trois-ans|archive-date=6 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> At the end of the 2010–11 season, he went on to make nineteen appearances and scoring once in all competitions. Reflecting on his first season at FC Metz, Manager Bijotat said of him, quoting: "Kalidou Koulibaly is perhaps the one who surprised the most people, while being the one who surprised me the least personally. I knew that it would come to him because it was already showing a good maturity. He's always in the right mood and does not catch fire, it's important to the job he's doing. He also knows how to analyze his own matches, which brings him to a certain regularity in his performances. Conversely, we thought [[Yeni Ngbakoto]] was the closest to the group, but it took longer to come. He had a difficult start, between suspension and injury. It took him longer to settle on the team. His game was not settled, in this area he has progressed in recent weeks and must still win in consistency."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fcmetz.com/2010-2011/actualites/equipe-pro/une-saison-dure-vivre|title=UNE SAISON " DURE À VIVRE "|publisher=FC Metz|language=fr|date=25 May 2011|access-date=6 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606173638/https://www.fcmetz.com/2010-2011/actualites/equipe-pro/une-saison-dure-vivre|archive-date=6 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

He played for the French under-20 team starting in 2011 and played six times during the [[2011 FIFA U-20 World Cup|FIFA U-20 World Cup]] in Colombia.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fcmetz.com/2010-2011/actualites/club/une-reprise-sans-koulibaly|title=UNE REPRISE SANS KOULIBALY|publisher=FC Metz|language=fr|date=21 June 2011|access-date=6 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606173230/https://www.fcmetz.com/2010-2011/actualites/club/une-reprise-sans-koulibaly|archive-date=6 June 2019|url-status=live}}<br>{{cite web|url=https://www.fcmetz.com/2012-2013/actualites/club/zoom-sur-les-defenseurs-centraux|title=ZOOM SUR LES DÉFENSEURS CENTRAUX|publisher=FC Metz|language=fr|date=1 December 2012|access-date=6 June 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190606173221/https://www.fcmetz.com/2012-2013/actualites/club/zoom-sur-les-defenseurs-centraux|archive-date=6 June 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>

==Style of play==
A large, aggressive, quick and physically strong yet elegant player, Koulibaly is recognised for his aerial prowess, anticipation, positioning, tackling, character, technique and passing ability as a defender. He has also been praised by pundits for his overall solidity as a player and his ability to make interceptions; however, he has also drawn criticism for giving away too many fouls. Due to his versatility, he can play both in his usual role as a [[Centre-back|central defender]], or as a [[Full-back (association football)|full-back]] on either the right or left flank, in both a three or four-man defence; he has even been deployed as a [[defensive midfielder]]. During his time at Napoli, his ability to play the ball out from the back saw him function as a ball-playing centre-back in manager [[Maurizio Sarri]]'s attacking, possession based-system.<ref name="swoop">{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/08/17/chelsea-swoop-for-napoli-defender-kalidou-koulibaly-in-club-reco/ |title=Chelsea swoop for Napoli defender Kalidou Koulibaly in club-record £60&nbsp;million deal |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |first=Jason |last=Burt |date=17 August 2016 |access-date=31 January 2017 |archive-date=26 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161026172653/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2016/08/17/chelsea-swoop-for-napoli-defender-kalidou-koulibaly-in-club-reco/ |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="altezza">{{cite news |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Serie-A/Napoli/19-07-2014/napoli-koulibaly-benitez-altezza-801281792307.shtml |title=Napoli, Koulibaly: "Mi rimetto a Benitez, la mia altezza è l'arma in più" |newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport |language=it |first=Alessio |last=D'Urso |date=19 July 2014 |access-date=31 January 2017 |archive-date=13 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170813183420/http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio/Serie-A/Napoli/19-07-2014/napoli-koulibaly-benitez-altezza-801281792307.shtml |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="K2 Koulibaly">{{cite news |url=http://www.corrieredellosport.it/news/calcio/serie-a/napoli/2016/02/04-8194497/k2_koulibaly_loro_del_napoli_in_vetta_pi_forte_di_ogni_razzismo/ |title=K2 Koulibaly, l'oro del Napoli in vetta.
