The '''Argentina–Netherlands football rivalry''' is a highly competitive [[List of sports rivalries|sports rivalry]] that exists between the national football teams of the two countries, as well as their respective sets of [[Fan (person)|fans]].

Unlike many football rivalries, this one is intercontinental, pairing the [[Argentina national football team|Argentinian team]] from [[South America]] with the [[Netherlands national football team|Dutch team]] from [[Europe]].

First meeting in an international friendly in May 1974, the two teams met just one month later in the group stage of the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]]. Since then, the matchup has become one of the most common in the World Cup, with the two teams meeting a total of six times during the tournament.

In total, the Netherlands have won four games to Argentina's one, with the other five other matches ending in a draw, including two victories for Argentina via penalty shootouts (2014 and 2022). {{refn|Three of the five draws were won by Argentina during penalty shoot-outs.<ref name=FIFA-NedvArg>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/articles/netherlands-argentina-messi-memphis-blind-di-maria-quarter-finals-fifa-world-cup-preview|title=Netherlands v Argentina: Team news, preview and how to watch|publisher=[[FIFA]]|accessdate=20 December 2022}}</ref><ref name=fbref>{{cite web|url=https://fbref.com/en/stathead/matchup/teams/f9fddd6e/5bb5024a/Argentina-vs-Netherlands-History|title=Argentina vs. Netherlands Historical Head-to-Head|website=[[Sports Reference|FBRef.com]]|publisher=[[Sports Reference]]|accessdate=20 December 2022}}</ref>|group=n|name=penres}}
