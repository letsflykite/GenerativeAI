'''Gareth Frank Bale''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|MBE}} (born 16 July 1989) is a Welsh former professional [[Association football|footballer]] who played as a [[Winger (association football)|winger]], most notably for [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] and [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]]. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players of his generation and one of the greatest Welsh players of all time.<ref name="BestLeftWingerNeville">{{Cite web |title='Gareth Bale probably the best left winger in the Premier League if not in Europe' – Everton's Phil Neville on the Tottenham star |url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/9/english-football/2012/01/11/2841436/gareth-bale-probably-the-best-left-winger-in-the-premier |access-date=20 March 2022 |website=Goal.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Richards |first=Alex |title=The 15 Best Wingers in World Football |url=https://bleacherreport.com/articles/1720086-the-15-best-wingers-in-world-football |access-date=11 November 2022 |website=Bleacher Report}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Potts Harmer |first=Alfie |date=25 December 2019 |title=7 Greates Right Wingers of the decade |url=https://www.hitc.com/en-gb/2019/12/25/7-greatest-right-wingers-of-the-decade/ |access-date=11 November 2022 |website=HITC Football}}</ref><ref name="auto1">{{Cite web |title=The 5 best Welsh Football Players of all-time |url=https://thesporting.blog/blog/the-5-best-welsh-football-players-of-all-time |access-date=11 November 2022 |website=The Sporting Blog}}</ref>

Bale began his professional career at [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], playing at [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left-back]] and earning acclaim as a [[Free kick (association football)|free-kick]] specialist. He moved to Tottenham Hotspur in 2007, for an eventual £7&nbsp;million fee. During his time at Tottenham, managerial and tactical shifts saw him transform into a more attacking player. From the 2009–10 season, under the guidance of [[Harry Redknapp]], Bale became an integral part of the team, rising to international attention during the [[2010–11 UEFA Champions League]]. In 2011 and 2013 he was named [[PFA Players' Player of the Year]], and was named in the [[UEFA Team of the Year]]. In 2013, he was also named [[PFA Young Player of the Year]], the [[FWA Footballer of the Year]] and the [[Premier League Player of the Season]]. He was nominated to the [[PFA Team of the Year]] three times in a row [[PFA Team of the Year (2010s)|between 2011 and 2013]].

Bale was transferred to Real Madrid in 2013 for an undisclosed fee, which was confirmed to be a [[List of most expensive association football transfers|world-record transfer fee]] of £85.1 million (€100.8&nbsp;million). Being part of the subsequent trio dubbed ''BBC'', alongside [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and [[Karim Benzema]], Bale helped the club to win the [[2013–14 Copa del Rey]] and [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]], scoring in both finals. The following [[2014–15 Real Madrid CF season|season]], he won the [[2014 UEFA Super Cup|UEFA Super Cup]] and scored in a third major final to help the club win the [[2014 FIFA Club World Cup|FIFA Club World Cup]]. Bale experienced a decrease in game time in the following seasons due to continual injuries, although he collected winner's medals in La Liga in [[2016–17 La Liga|2016–17]] and [[2019–20 La Liga|2019–20]], as well as three additional Champions League titles in [[2015–16 UEFA Champions League|2015–16]], [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League|2016–17]] and [[2017–18 UEFA Champions League|2017–18]], among other trophies; he featured in all three consecutive finals, scoring twice – once with an [[overhead kick]] – in Real Madrid's [[2018 UEFA Champions League Final]] victory. In [[2020–21 Tottenham Hotspur F.C. season|2020–21]], he returned to Tottenham on [[Loan (sports)|loan]], and the following [[2021–22 Real Madrid CF season|season]], his last for Real Madrid, he collected another [[2021–22 La Liga|league title]] as well as his fifth [[2021–22 UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] title, despite gaining little playing time. He subsequently joined MLS club Los Angeles FC in July 2022 and won the [[Supporters' Shield]] and [[MLS Cup]], before retiring in January 2023 aged 33.

Bale made his senior international debut for Wales in May 2006, becoming the youngest player at that point to represent Wales. He then went on to earn 111 caps and scored 41 international goals, making him Wales' [[Wales national football team#Most caps|most capped player]] and [[Wales national football team#Most goals|top goalscorer of all time]]. He was the top scorer for Wales in their successful qualifying campaign for [[UEFA Euro 2016]], scoring seven goals; he subsequently represented Wales in the final tournament as they reached the semi-finals, scoring three goals. He later featured for the side at [[UEFA Euro 2020|Euro 2020]] and was pivotal in Wales' qualifying for the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], ending a 64-year appearance drought at the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]]. He was named [[Welsh Footballer of the Year]] a record six times.

He is one of the most unselfish individuals that I have had the pleasure to help educate."<ref>{{Cite news |date=13 January 2007 |title=Young Gareth made own rules |work=The Daily Echo}}</ref></blockquote>

==Club career==
===Southampton===
On 17 April 2006, at the age of 16 years and 275 days, Bale became the second youngest player ever to play for Southampton (after [[Theo Walcott]], who was 132 days younger) when he made his debut in the Saints' 2–0 victory against [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]].

On 2 December 2007, Bale was substituted after sustaining an injury resulting from a tackle from [[Fabrice Muamba]] in the league fixture against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]].

====2009–2011====
In June 2009, Bale underwent surgery for a knee injury, ruling him out for over two months.

Bale, who met the age criteria to play in the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2012 London Olympics]], said in May 2011 "I want to play in the Olympics" for the [[Great Britain men's Olympic football team|Great Britain Olympic football team]], in defiance of the FAW.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Draper |first=Rob |date=30 June 2012 |title=London 2012: Gareth Bale to miss Olympics with injury |work=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/18657042 |access-date=27 September 2018}}</ref> On 28 October 2011, Bale became the first player to be photographed modelling the British 2012 London Olympics football supporters' shirt.

At the end of June 2012, Bale pulled out of the tournament with a back injury. On 29 June, he advised the Team GB football manager, [[Stuart Pearce]], that he would not be available for selection as he had aggravated an old back and hip injury during a training run.

Tottenham released a statement in relation to Bale's non-selection for Team GB, they stated that "Gareth sustained an injury as he built up his fitness ahead of joining up with Stuart Pearce's side.
