'''Kwon Chang-hoon''' ({{lang-ko|권창훈}}; born 30 June 1994) is a South Korean professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as an [[attacking midfielder]] for [[K League 1]] club [[Suwon Samsung Bluewings]] and the [[South Korea national football team|South Korea national team]].

==Early life==
Kwon started playing football when he was in YangJeon Elementary School in Seoul. After he graduated from Joongdong Middle School, he went to Maetan High School to join the [[Suwon Samsung Bluewings Academy|under-18 team]] of [[Suwon Samsung Bluewings]].

==Club career==

===Suwon Samsung Bluewings===
[[File:Coréia do Sul x México - Futebol masculino - Olimpíada Rio 2016 (28792989102).jpg|thumb|upright|Kwon in a match against Mexico during the 2016 Olympics]]
Suwon Samsung Bluewings signed Kwon under homegrown player rule during the 2012 K League draft. He made his senior debut as a substitute in the 79th minute in an [[AFC Champions League]] match against [[Kashiwa Reysol]] on 3 April 2013. He also made his K League debut against [[Daegu FC]] on 6 April, playing as a substitute for 25 minutes. He was selected for the [[K League Best XI|K League 1 Best XI]] in 2015 and 2016 while playing for Suwon. He challenged France's [[Ligue 1]] after growing as one of the top midfielders in the K League.

===Dijon===
In January 2017, Kwon joined [[Dijon FCO|Dijon]] on a 3.5-year deal. The transfer fee paid to Suwon was estimated at €1.5 million.<ref>{{cite news|title=Transfert : le Sud-Coréen Kwon Chang-hoon à Dijon (officiel)|url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/Actualites/Transfert-le-sud-coreen-kwon-chang-hoon-a-dijon-officiel/769968|access-date=21 August 2017|work=L'Équipe|date=18 January 2017|language=fr}}</ref> In the [[2017–18 Ligue 1]], Kwon quickly established himself as an ace player for Dijon, finishing joint Dijon's top scorer with 11 goals in 34 league appearances. However, he injured his Achilles tendon during the last league match, and failed to show his former performance since then.

===SC Freiburg===
On 28 June 2019, Kwon joined [[Bundesliga]] side [[SC Freiburg]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Changhoon Kwon wechselt an die Dreisam|url=https://www.scfreiburg.com/node/24444|access-date=28 June 2019|work=SC Freiburg|date=28 June 2019|language=de|archive-date=17 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210117060723/https://www.scfreiburg.com/node/24444|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=S.

However, he had to stop his challenge in the Bundesliga to do mandatory military service in South Korea. He returned to his former club Suwon Samsung Bluewings, and prepared to enlist in military football club [[Gimcheon Sangmu FC|Gimcheon Sangmu]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://m.khan.co.kr/sports/football/article/202105262036025#c2b |script-title=ko:권창훈, 수원 복귀…짧은 6개월 ‘친정’에 복덩이 될까 |publisher=Kyunghyang |lang=ko |date=2021-05-26 |access-date=2023-05-22}}</ref>
