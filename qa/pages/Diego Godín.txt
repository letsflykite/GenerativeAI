==Style of play==
Despite his lack of pace or significant athleticism, Godín was regarded by pundits as one of the best and most consistent defenders in the world, and as one of the leading centre-backs of his generation. During the 2018 World Cup, Jack Watson of ''[[The Independent]]'' described him as "the best central defender in the world."<ref name=Contenders/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/uruguay-vs-portugal-world-cup-2018-cristiano-ronaldo-atletico-real-madrid-analysis-report-a8424946.html|title=Uruguay vs Portugal: Diego Godin proves why he remains one of the world's best – scouting report|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|last=Watson|first=Jack|date=30 June 2018|access-date=18 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://it.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/024f-0e998114e867-86fc910d523a-1000--diego-godin-la-roccia-della-difesa-dell-atletico/?referrer=%2Fuefachampionsleague%2Fnews%2Fnewsid%3D2453275|title=Diego Godín: la roccia della difesa dell'Atlético|trans-title=Diego Godín: Atlético's defensive rock|publisher=UEFA|language=it|date=11 March 2019|access-date=18 May 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/101-greatest-football-players-last-25-years-full-list|title=Ranked!

An intelligent centre-back, Godín was mainly known for his leadership, positioning and calm composure, which allowed him to organise his back-line, read the game and anticipate plays. Aggressive, competitive and physical, he was also known for his aerial ability and his capacity to time his jumps effectively, which enabled him to defend high balls, score goals with his head on set pieces, and beat out larger players to the ball in the air.<ref name=Uomo/><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ultimouomo.com/contraerea-diego-godin/|title=Contraerea Diego Godin|trans-title=Antiaircraft Diego Godin|publisher=Ultimo Uomo|last=D'Ottavi|first=Marco|language=it|date=28 May 2016|access-date=18 May 2020}}</ref><ref name=Milan>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/fifa-world-cup/4/blog/post/3527895/fearless-godin-a-throwback-to-milanesque-defending|title=Fearless Godin a throwback to Milanesque defending|publisher=ESPN|last=Gupta|first=Jayaditya|date=15 June 2018|access-date=18 May 2020}}</ref><ref name=Hardman>{{cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/en-om/news/move-over-sergio-ramos-uruguay-hardman-diego-godin-is-the/1e6gwl1mbaelh1y2g2sed45uok|title=Move over Ramos, Uruguay hardman Godin is the best defender in the world|publisher=Goal|last=Doyle|first=Mark|date=30 June 2018|access-date=18 May 2020}}</ref><ref name=Trends>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/century-diego-godin-defy-trends-modern-football-atletico-madrid-inter-a9156056.html|title=Why Diego Godin was a cast-iron defender who single-handedly defied the trends of modern football|newspaper=The Independent|last=Delaney|first=Miguel|date=15 October 2019|access-date=18 May 2020}}</ref>

Godín also stood out for his capacity to time his challenges, make blocks, interceptions and win the ball. Moreover, he was strong in one–on-one situations as his defensive positioning often allowed opposition players little time or space on the ball.<ref name=Uomo/><ref name=Milan/><ref name=Trends/><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/ball-winning-as-the-best-form-of-defence-is-becoming-a-dying-art-in-our-game-danny-higginbotham-a6856311.html|title=Ball-winning as the best form of defence is becoming a dying art in our game – Danny Higginbotham|newspaper=The Independent|last=Higginbotham|first=Danny|date=5 February 2016|access-date=18 May 2020}}</ref> In addition to his defensive skills, he was also known for his technique, ball–playing ability and capacity to carry the ball out from the defence, which allowed him start plays from the back and create chances for teammates.<ref name=Milan/><ref name=Hardman/>

==Personal life==
Godín married Sofia, daughter of [[José Herrera (Uruguayan footballer)|José Herrera]], a Uruguayan international who played in Serie A for Cagliari alongside compatriot [[Enzo Francescoli]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.football-italia.net/141305/godin-inter-atletico-madrid|title=Godin: 'Inter like Atletico Madrid'|publisher=Football Italia|date=27 July 2019|access-date=6 October 2019}}</ref> He is close friends with [[Antoine Griezmann]], who played with him at Atlético Madrid. During the 2018 World Cup quarter-finals match against France, the latter did not celebrate his goal out of respect for the former and also club teammate [[José María Giménez]]; Godín is also godfather to Griezmann's daughter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/france/story/3558355/antoine-griezmann-explains-his-lack-of-celebration-vs-uruguay-friends|title=Antoine Griezmann explains his lack of celebration vs. Uruguay 'friends'|publisher=ESPN|last=Johnson|first=Jonathan|date=6 July 2018|access-date=24 February 2021}}</ref>
