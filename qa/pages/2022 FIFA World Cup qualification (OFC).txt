The Oceanian section of the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification]] acted as qualifiers for the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], to be held in Qatar, for national teams which are members of the [[Oceania Football Confederation]] (OFC). A total of 0.5 slots in the final tournament were available for OFC teams, which equated to one inter-confederation play-off slot.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y=2015/m=5/news=current-allocation-of-fifa-world-cuptm-confederation-slots-maintained-2610611.html|title=Current allocation of FIFA World Cup confederation slots maintained|publisher=FIFA.com|date=30 May 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530211217/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/y%3D2015/m%3D5/news%3Dcurrent-allocation-of-fifa-world-cuptm-confederation-slots-maintained-2610611.html|archivedate=30 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Oceania]], the qualification was held as a centralised tournament in Qatar from 17 to 30 March 2022.<ref name="update"/>

==Format==
In November 2021, the OFC confirmed the format for the qualifiers in response to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oceaniafootball.com/format-set-for-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022-ofc-preliminary-competition/|title=Format set for FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 OFC preliminary competition|publisher=Oceania Football Confederation|date=29 November 2021}}</ref> The qualifying stage was to be a single match on 13 March 2022 between the two lowest-ranked participating OFC nations in the [[FIFA World Rankings]], with the winner advancing to the group stage, but [[Tonga national football team|Tonga]] withdrew from the qualification match causing [[Cook Islands national football team|Cook Islands]] to automatically enter the group stage. Then eight remaining teams were drawn into two groups of four, playing single leg [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]]. The top two teams from each group advanced to a single leg knockout stage. The final winner advanced to the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification (inter-confederation play-offs)|inter-confederation play-offs]].

==Entrants==
On 28 July 2020, the OFC confirmed that the qualifications would involve all eleven OFC teams.<ref>{{cite press release |title=OFC tournaments update |author=OFC Media Officer |date=28 July 2020 |work=OFC |url=https://www.oceaniafootball.com/ofc-tournaments-update/ |access-date=2 February 2022}}</ref> On 29 November 2021, the date of the group stage draw, FIFA reported that nine of the eleven FIFA-affiliated national teams from the OFC would enter qualification, as [[American Samoa national football team|American Samoa]] and [[Samoa national football team|Samoa]] had withdrawn.<ref name="update">{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/media-releases/update-on-fifa-club-world-cup-and-ofc-preliminary-competition-for-qatar-2022|title=Update on FIFA Club World Cup and OFC preliminary competition for Qatar 2022|date=29 November 2021|publisher=[[FIFA]]}}</ref> On 29 January 2022, two months after the group stage draw but two months before the competition was to begin, [[Tonga national football team|Tonga]] also withdrew due to the [[2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption and tsunami]].<ref name="Tonga withdrew">{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/mens/worldcup/qatar2022/news/tonga-withdraw-from-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022-tm-ofc-preliminary-competition|title=Tonga withdraw from FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 OFC preliminary competition|date=29 January 2022|publisher=[[FIFA]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.oceaniafootball.com/tonga-out-of-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022-ofc-preliminary-competition-following-disaster/ |title=Tonga out of FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 OFC preliminary competition following disaster |work=[[Oceania Football Confederation]] |date=28 January 2022 |access-date=28 January 2022}}</ref> On 19 March 2022, [[Vanuatu national football team|Vanuatu]] withdrew after the tournament had started due to the majority of players testing positive for COVID-19.<ref name="Vanuatu withdraw"/><ref>{{cite news |title=Vanuatu withdraw from Oceania World Cup qualifying; Cook Islands also hit by Covid-19 |url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/world-game/128109015/vanuatu-withdraw-from-oceania-world-cup-qualifying-cook-islands-also-hit-by-covid19 |work=[[Stuff (website)|Stuff]] |date=19 March 2022 |language=en}}</ref> On 23 March 2022, [[Cook Islands national football team|Cook Islands]] also withdrew after the tournament had started due to players testing positive for COVID-19.<ref name="Cook Islands withdraw"/>

==Schedule==
Qualifying was initially expected to begin in September 2020,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/football/nz-teams/118487762/new-zealand-football-successful-with-bid-to-host-the-2020-ofc-nations-cup|title=New Zealand Football successful with bid to host the 2020 OFC Nations Cup|work=Stuff|date=10 January 2020}}</ref> but many international matches scheduled for the FIFA window in that month were cancelled in June 2020 due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic]], while the [[#Inter-confederation play-off|inter-confederation play-offs]] were also moved from March to June 2022.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/who-we-are/news/fifa-council-unanimously-approves-covid-19-relief-plan|title=FIFA Council unanimously approves COVID-19 Relief Plan|publisher=FIFA.com|date=25 June 2020}}</ref>

In November 2020, the OFC announced a further delay in the qualifying process until June 2021.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oceaniafootball.com/ofc-announces-schedule-changes-for-early-2021/|title=OFC announces schedule changes for early 2021|publisher=Oceania Football Confederation|date=5 November 2020}}</ref>

In March 2021, the confederation announced that this timeframe would not be achievable either, outlining a potential option organise a competition in January 2022, keeping the FIFA International Match Calendar dates in March available for preparation matches ahead of the inter-confederation play-off in June.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oceaniafootball.com/ofc-confirms-schedule-changes/|title=OFC confirms schedule changes|publisher=Oceania Football Confederation|date=4 March 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://digitalhub.fifa.com/m/11f7fa1dc502361/original/Enclosure_Circular-1766_Updates-to-the-Men-s-International-Match-Calendar_EN.pdf|title=INTERNATIONAL MATCH CALENDAR 2020–2024|publisher=FIFA}}</ref> [[Fiji]] and [[New Caledonia]] were proposed as possible venues.<ref name="2022 Calendar">{{cite web|url=https://www.ftf.pf/cms/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/OFC_Competitions_2022_calendar_20210604-1.pdf|title=OFC Competitions 2022 Calendar (updated 4/6/2021)|publisher=Fédération Tahitienne de Football|work=Oceania Football Confederation|date=4 June 2021}}</ref>

By September 2021, continued delays meant that the OFC felt it was "not possible at this time to organise a qualifying competition within the Oceania region" and, as an alternative, they requested FIFA's approval for the qualification to be held in Qatar in March 2022.<ref name="Qatar"/><ref name="schedule"/> This was confirmed by FIFA on 29 November 2021.<ref name="update"/>

==Venues==
The matches are played at two venues in the city of [[Doha]].

==Qualification match==
A qualification match was due to be held between the two lowest-ranked teams ([[Tonga national football team|Tonga]] and the [[Cook Islands national football team|Cook Islands]]) to determine the eighth team to compete in the group stage. The match was cancelled after Tonga withdrew due to the effects of the [[2022 Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai eruption and tsunami]]; the Cook Islands advanced to the group stage.<ref name="Tonga withdrew"/>

==Group stage==
The seven highest ranking OFC teams which entered the competition were given a bye to the group stage alongside the winner of the [[#Qualification match|qualification match]]. The teams were divided into two groups, each containing four teams. Each team played every other team in their group once in a [[Round-robin tournament|round-robin format]], and the winners and runners-up of each group advanced to the semi-finals.<ref name="update"/>

===Draw===
The group stage draw was held in [[Zürich]], Switzerland on 29 November 2021, 21:00 [[Central European Time|CET]] (30 November, 09:00 [[New Zealand Daylight Time|NZDT]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.oceaniafootball.com/date-set-for-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022-ofc-preliminary-draw/|title=Date set for FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 OFC Preliminary Draw|publisher=Oceania Football Confederation|date=26 November 2021|access-date=26 November 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/media-releases/date-set-for-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022-ofc-preliminary-draw |title=Date set for FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 OFC Preliminary Draw |work=FIFA |date=25 November 2021 |access-date=29 November 2021}}</ref> The identity of the [[#Qualification match|qualification match]] winner was not known at the time of the draw. The draw began with pot 2 and finished with pot 1, with teams being allocated to the groups sequentially (firstly A, then B). The first two teams drawn were assigned to position 4, while the next two were assigned to position 3, and the first two from pot 1 to position 2. The two highest ranked teams, [[New Zealand national football team|New Zealand]] and the [[Solomon Islands national football team|Solomon Islands]], were assigned to positions A1 and B1, and were therefore not drawn in the same group.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://digitalhub.fifa.com/m/70e94fce4d30925f/original/OFC-draw-procedures.pdf |title=OFC Preliminary Draw for the FIFA World Cup 2022: Draw Procedures |work=FIFA |date=29 November 2021 |access-date=29 November 2021 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20211129085231/https://digitalhub.fifa.com/m/70e94fce4d30925f/original/OFC-draw-procedures.pdf |archive-date=29 November 2021}}</ref>
