===Status of Russia===
On 9 December 2019, the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]] initially handed Russia a four-year ban from all major international sporting events, after [[Russian Anti-Doping Agency|RUSADA]] was found non-compliant for handing over manipulated lab data to investigators.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/olympics/50710598 |title=Russia banned for four years to include 2020 Olympics and 2022 World Cup |publisher=BBC |date=9 December 2019 |access-date=9 December 2019}}</ref> However, the [[Russia national football team|Russia national team]] could still enter qualification, as the ban only applies to the World Cup proper as a world championship.

* '''Group stage''': Five groups of five teams and five groups of six teams. Group winners qualified for the World Cup finals.
* '''Play-off stage''': 12 teams (ten group runners-up and two best Nations League group winners, based on the [[2020–21 UEFA Nations League#Overall ranking|Nations League overall ranking]], that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group) were drawn into three play-off paths, playing two rounds of single-match playoffs (semi-finals with the seeded teams to host, followed by finals, with the home teams to be drawn). The three path winners qualified for the World Cup finals.

On 4 December 2019, the UEFA Executive Committee initially approved the use of the [[video assistant referee]] system for the qualifiers.<ref name="ExCo 4 December"/> However, VAR was not implemented at the start of qualification due to the impact of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] on operational and logistical capabilities.<ref>{{cite news |location=Paris |url=https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20210329-pandemic-blamed-for-lack-of-var-in-world-cup-qualifiers-after-ronaldo-fury |title=Pandemic blamed for lack of VAR in World Cup qualifiers after Ronaldo fury |website=[[France 24]] |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=29 March 2021 |access-date=29 March 2021}}</ref> On 5 August 2021, UEFA announced that the VAR system would be used for the remainder of qualification, starting from September 2021.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/mediaservices/mediareleases/news/026c-12ecc2a8d70d-81f2eea80210-1000/ |title=VAR to be used at European Qualifiers as of September 2021 |work=UEFA |date=5 August 2021 |access-date=5 August 2021}}</ref>

*'''Nations League finalists''': The four teams participating in the [[2021 UEFA Nations League Finals]] (Belgium, France, Italy and Spain) were guaranteed to be drawn into groups with only five teams (Groups A–E). A group could contain a maximum of one Nations League finalist (this condition was in fact fulfilled automatically, since all four teams were in the same pot).
*'''Prohibited clashes:''' For political reasons, matches between following pairs of teams were considered prohibited clashes, unable to be drawn into the same group: ([[Bosnia and Herzegovina's reaction to the 2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|Kosovo—Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Kosovo–Serbia relations|Kosovo–Serbia]], [[Russia–Serbia relations#Kosovo issue|Kosovo–Russia]], [[Russo-Ukrainian War|Russia–Ukraine]]. Additionally, [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict|Armenia–Azerbaijan]] and [[Status of Gibraltar|Gibraltar–Spain]] were identified as prohibited clashes, but the teams in the former pair were in the same pot for the draw, while the teams in the latter pair were restricted to different-sized groups based on draw pots and conditions.)
*'''Winter venues:''' A maximum of two teams whose venues are identified as having high or medium risk of severe winter conditions could be placed in each group: Belarus, Estonia, Faroe Islands, Finland, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Norway, Russia, Ukraine.
**The two "hard winter venues" (Faroe Islands and Iceland) generally cannot host games in March or November, and therefore could not be drawn together; the others shall play as few home matches as possible in March and November.
*'''Excessive travel:''' A maximum of one pair of teams identified with excessive travel distance in relation to other countries could be placed in each group:
**Azerbaijan: with Iceland, Gibraltar, Portugal.
**Iceland: with Armenia, Cyprus, Georgia, Israel.
**Kazakhstan: with England, France, Gibraltar, Iceland, Malta, Northern Ireland, Portugal, Republic of Ireland, Scotland, Spain, Wales. (Andorra and Faroe Islands were also identified with Kazakhstan for excessive travel distance, but the teams were in the same pot for the draw.)
