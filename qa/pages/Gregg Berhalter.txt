===Professional===
[[File:Gregg Berhalter.jpg|right|thumb|Berhalter in 2007]]
Berhalter left UNC after his junior year, signing with Dutch club [[FC Zwolle|Zwolle]] in 1994. He later played for [[Sparta Rotterdam]] and [[SC Cambuur Leeuwarden]] in the Netherlands (later they also had U.S.-born executive [[Alex Pama]] there), and with [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] in England (where he briefly played alongside [[Jovan Kirovski]]). During his time at Crystal Palace, he scored once against Bradford City.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/1730557.stm |title=Bradford 1-2 C Palace |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=December 29, 2001 |access-date=December 28, 2010}}</ref>

In 2002, Berhalter signed with [[FC Energie Cottbus|Energie Cottbus]] of the German [[Bundesliga]]. He went on to make 111 league appearances with the team, captaining them to a promotion back to the Bundesliga. In 2006, Berhalter signed with [[TSV 1860 Munich]] of the [[2. Bundesliga]], and was named captain of the team. He stayed there for a further two and a half years, making 73 league appearances for ''Die Löwen''.

After a 15-year career in Europe, Berhalter moved back to the United States in April 2009. He signed a contract with [[Major League Soccer]], his first club contract in his home country. He was revealed as a [[LA Galaxy|Los Angeles Galaxy]] player on April 3, 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.lagalaxy.com/news/2009/04/galaxy-sign-veteran-defender-berhalter | title = Galaxy sign veteran defender Berhalter | publisher = LA Galaxy | date = April 3, 2009 | access-date = June 16, 2013}}</ref> In his first season with the Galaxy, their goals against were cut in half—from 61 to 30—with Berhalter being a leader in defense while mentoring [[Omar Gonzalez]] to Rookie of the Year honors.

On November 14, 2009, he scored in the 103rd minute of the scoreless Western Conference final, propelling the Galaxy to a 2–0 win over the [[Houston Dynamo]] and into the [[2009 MLS Cup]]. It was his first goal in 28 appearances with the club.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-galaxy14-2009nov14,0,4528736.story | title = Galaxy 2, Houston 0 (ot) Overtime win puts Galaxy in MLS final| newspaper = LA Times | date = November 14, 2009 | access-date = October 30, 2010}}</ref>

In his second season, the Galaxy won the MLS Supporters Shield and further reduced their goals against to 26 for the season, a Galaxy record.

On October 12, 2011, Berhalter announced his decision to retire at the end of the 2011 MLS season.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2011/10/12/las-berhalter-announces-retirement-after-lengthy-career | title = LA's Berhalter announces retirement after lengthy career | date = October 12, 2011 | access-date = December 27, 2011 | publisher = mlssoccer.com}}</ref>

===International===
Berhalter earned his first cap for the [[United States men's national soccer team|U.S. national team]] on October 15, 1994, against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]]. Berhalter played a significant role for the U.S. at the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], stepping in for the injured [[Jeff Agoos]] and starting the last two games, and in doing so became the first [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] player to play in a World Cup match.

On May 25, 2006, Berhalter was added to the U.S. national team's roster for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], replacing the injured [[Cory Gibbs]]. Berhalter expressed confidence in the ability of the team in the run up to the tournament,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.boston.com/sports/articles/2006/06/12/czechs_and_balances_us_foe_able_aching?mode=PF | title = Czechs and balances: US foe able, aching | publisher = [[The Boston Globe]] | date = June 12, 2006 | access-date = October 30, 2010}}</ref> but was an unused substitute in all three group games. The U.S. was eliminated after finishing at the bottom of Group E in the first round with one draw and two defeats.

==Coaching career==
===Hammarby IF===
Following a season as Los Angeles Galaxy's assistant coach, Berhalter was named head coach for Swedish club [[Hammarby Fotboll|Hammarby IF]] on December 12, 2011.<ref name="Gregg Berhalter to coach in Sweden">{{cite news|title=Gregg Berhalter to coach in Sweden|url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/7344921/ex-us-team-los-angeles-galaxy-defender-gregg-berhalter-hired-coach-sweden-hammarby|access-date=January 30, 2014|newspaper=ESPN|date=December 12, 2011|agency=Associated Press}}</ref> At the time, the team was playing in [[Superettan]], the second-tier. Although it is a common misconception, Berhalter was not the first American to ever manage a professional soccer team in Europe. The first American to ever manage a professional soccer team in Europe was [[Thomas Dooley]], who managed  [[1. FC Saarbrücken]] during the 2002-2003 season.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://m.faz.net/aktuell/sport/1-fc-saarbruecken-tom-dooley-ist-schon-trainer-nummer-drei-150992.amp.html | title = Tom Dooley ist schon Trainer Nummer drei | publisher = m.faz.net | date = January 18, 2002 | access-date = March 23, 2022 | first = Phil | last = Shore}}</ref> Berhalter was fired on July 24, 2013, for a "lack of attacking play".<ref name="American Exports: Hammarby fire Gregg Berhalter as manager, citing team's lack of offense">{{cite news|last=Seltzer|first=Greg|title=American Exports: Hammarby fire Gregg Berhalter as manager, citing team's lack of attacking play|url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/07/24/american-exports-hammarby-fire-gregg-berhalter-manager-citing-teams-lack-off|access-date=January 30, 2014|newspaper=Major League Soccer|date=July 23, 2013|archive-date=January 31, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140131035938/http://www.mlssoccer.com/news/article/2013/07/24/american-exports-hammarby-fire-gregg-berhalter-manager-citing-teams-lack-off|url-status=dead}}</ref> Hammarby were in eighth place at the time of the sacking.<ref name="Superettan 2013">{{cite web|title=Sweden » Superettan 2013 » 15.

===Columbus Crew SC===
Berhalter became the [[Director of Football|sporting director]] and head coach of [[Columbus Crew]] on November 6, 2013.<ref name="Former Galaxy player-coach Gregg Berhalter named Columbus manager">{{cite news|title=Former Galaxy player-coach Gregg Berhalter named Columbus manager|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/nov/06/sports/la-sp-sn-former-galaxy-player-coach-berhalter-columbus-manager-20131106|access-date=January 30, 2014|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=November 6, 2013}}</ref>

Under Berhalter, Columbus Crew SC qualified for the playoffs in 2014, 2015, 2017 and 2018. They reached the [[MLS Cup 2015]] but lost at home 2–1 to the Portland Timbers.

===United States===
On December 2, 2018, Berhalter became the head coach of the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]].<ref name="ussoccer.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2018/12/02/11/42/20181202-news-mnt-gregg-berhalter-named-us-mens-national-team-head-coach|title = Gregg Berhalter Named Head Coach of U.S. Men's National Team}}</ref> He earned his first victory as coach in a friendly against Panama on January 27, 2019.<ref>{{cite web|title=U.S. beats Panama as Gregg Berhalter wins debut match as manager|work=ESPN|agency=Reuters|date=January 27, 2019|url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/report?gameId=529217|access-date=June 6, 2020}}</ref> Berhalter coached the United States to a continental championship on August 1, 2021, at the [[2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup]].

The team subsequently qualified for and reached the round of 16 in the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]].

Berhalter's contract expired on December 31, 2022, with assistant [[Anthony Hudson (soccer)|Anthony Hudson]] named interim head coach while a search for a permanent replacement commenced. Hudson remained in charge through May 2023 before departing to become the head coach of [[Al-Markhiya SC]] in Qatar; he was replaced by fellow assistant [[B.J. Callaghan]]. 

On June 16, 2023, U.S. Soccer announced that Berhalter would return as the head coach of the United States through the [[2026 FIFA World Cup]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Gregg Berhalter Chosen To Lead U.S. Men's National Team To 2026 FIFA World Cup {{!}} U.S. Soccer Official Website |url=https://www.ussoccer.com/stories/2023/06/gregg-berhalter-chosen-to-lead-us-mens-national-team-to-2026-fifa-world-cup |access-date=2023-06-16 |website=www.ussoccer.com |language=en}}</ref> Sporting director [[Matt Crocker]] cited Berhalter's "vision, as well as the experience and growth mindset on and off the field to move [the] team forward" as the U.S. prepares to host the 2026 World Cup with Mexico and Canada.

==Personal life==
Berhalter lives in the [[Lake View, Chicago|Lake View]] neighborhood of [[Chicago]] with his wife Rosalind, with whom he has four children.<ref>{{cite news |last=Goldsborough |first=Bob |date=July 11, 2019 |title=U.S. men's soccer coach Gregg Berhalter buys contemporary mansion in Southport Corridor for $2.61 million |url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/real-estate/elite-street/ct-re-gregg-berhalter-southport-home-20190711-7rxwxb3lpjakhjrnwqqkbcz3wi-story.html |work=Chicago Tribune |access-date=July 11, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=April 4, 2014 |title=An Exacting Man: Columbus Crew Coach Gregg Berhalter |url=https://www.columbusmonthly.com/article/20140404/LIFESTYLE/304049536 |work=[[Columbus Monthly]] |access-date=July 11, 2020}}</ref> One of his sons, [[Sebastian Berhalter|Sebastian]], plays for the [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC|Vancouver Whitecaps]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Baer |first=Benjamin |date=January 17, 2020 |title=Columbus Crew SC sign Sebastian Berhalter, Gregg's son, to Homegrown deal |url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/post/2020/01/17/columbus-crew-sc-sign-sebastian-berhalter-greggs-son-homegrown-deal |work=MLSsoccer.com |access-date=July 11, 2020}}</ref> His brother, Jay, served as the chief commercial officer of the [[United States Soccer Federation]] until his resignation in 2020.<ref>{{cite magazine |last=Creditor |first=Avi |date=February 6, 2020 |title=Jay Berhalter is Leaving the U.S. Soccer Federation |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2020/02/07/jay-berhalter-out-us-soccer-federation-gregg |magazine=Sports Illustrated |access-date=July 11, 2020}}</ref> 

On January 3, 2023, Berhalter issued a statement saying that in 1991, he had kicked his future wife in the legs after an argument. The U.S. Soccer Federation said it was investigating what had happened.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Agencies |date=2023-01-03 |title=USA coach Gregg Berhalter admits to kicking future wife in 1991 incident |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jan/03/usa-coach-gregg-berhalter-blackmail-attempt |access-date=2023-01-03 |website=the Guardian |language=en}}</ref> It was later revealed that it was [[Danielle Reyna]], mother of [[Giovanni Reyna]], who contacted the U.S. Soccer Federation about the incident "because she was frustrated by comments made about her son after the team's elimination from the 2022 World Cup."<ref>{{Cite web |date=2023-01-04 |title=Gio Reyna's mother gave USSF Berhalter info |url=https://www.espn.com/soccer/united-states-usa/story/4844539/reynas-told-us-soccer-about-past-gregg-berhalter-domestic-violence-incident-sources |access-date=2023-01-04 |website=ESPN.com |language=en}}</ref> Berhalter publicly addressed issues regarding an anonymous player for a lack of commitment and poor attitude, and confirmed that the team had held a meeting to determine if that player were to remain with the team in Qatar for the remainder of the tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://worldsoccertalk.com/news/gregg-berhalter-airs-out-dirty-laundry-on-gio-reyna-20221212-WST-412086.html|title=Gregg Berhalter airs dirty laundry on Gio Reyna|author=Kyle Fansler|website=worldsoccertalk.com|date=December 12, 2022|accessdate=January 4, 2023}}</ref> On December 12, 2022, Reyna confirmed that he was the aforementioned player about whom Berhalter was speaking, and apologized for his behavior while criticizing the decision to publicize the information.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://worldsoccertalk.com/news/gio-reyna-criticizes-gregg-berhalter-in-instagram-post-20221212-WST-412150.html|title=Gio Reyna criticizes Gregg Berhalter in Instagram post|author=Kyle Fansler|website=worldsoccertalk.com|date=December 12, 2022|accessdate=January 4, 2023}}</ref>

On March 13, 2023, the U.S. Soccer Federation said a probe into the dispute with Berhalter's wife had concluded U.S. Soccer was not in the wrong for hiring him as the national team coach.  The conclusions meant there was no legal impediment to employing Berhalter, who remained a candidate for the coaching job until ultimately being rehired in June 2023.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Tenorio |first=Paul |title=USSF's Gregg Berhalter investigation explained: Findings, Reynas' involvement, what's next |url=https://theathletic.com/4304622/2023/03/13/gregg-berhalter-us-soccer-investigation-explained/ |access-date=2023-03-13 |website=The Athletic |language=en}}</ref>
