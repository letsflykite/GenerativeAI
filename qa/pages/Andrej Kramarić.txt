==Club career==
===Dinamo Zagreb===
[[File:Andrej Kramarić 2009.JPG|thumb|upright|Kramarić playing for [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] in 2009]]

Kramarić joined [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] when he was just six years old.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Tri nova bisera omladinske škole|url=http://www.nk-dinamo.hr/vijest/prikaz/1671/default.aspx|publisher=Dinamo Zagreb|date=17 June 2009|access-date=5 September 2009|language=hr|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620182338/http://www.nk-dinamo.hr/vijest/prikaz/1671/Default.aspx|archive-date=20 June 2009|url-status=dead}}</ref> During his youth career, he scored over 450 goals for [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb Academy|Dinamo youth teams]], making him the top youth scorer in club history.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Kramarić je za Dinamo već zabio 450 golova!|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/sport/nogomet/clanak/art-2009,6,26,,167550.jl|publisher=Jutarnji list|date=29 June 2009|access-date=5 September 2009|language=hr}}</ref>

Kramarić made his debut for the Dinamo senior squad on 24 May 2009 in a [[2008–09 Croatian First Football League|league]] match against [[NK Zagreb|Zagreb]]. He made an appearance as a 69th-minute substitute for [[Josip Tadić]].<ref>{{Cite news|title=Dinamo – Zagreb 0:1|url=http://www.nk-dinamo.hr/page/4/vijest/prikaz/1631/default.aspx|publisher=Dinamo Zagreb|date=24 May 2009|access-date=8 September 2009|language=hr}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> It was also his only match for the Dinamo first-team during the [[2008–09 NK Dinamo Zagreb season|2008–09 season]].

Kramarić was promoted to the first-team squad the [[2009–10 NK Dinamo Zagreb season|following season]]. He made his first appearance of the season and also debuted in the [[2009–10 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] on 15 July in an away match against [[FC Pyunik|Pyunik]], which finished in a goalless draw.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Dinamo neriješeno s Pyunikom|url=http://www.nk-dinamo.hr/page/2/vijest/prikaz/1747/default.aspx|publisher=Dinamo Zagreb|date=2 August 2009|access-date=8 September 2009|language=hr}}{{Dead link|date=October 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Later that year, Kramarić won his first [[2009–10 Croatian First Football League|league title]] with Dinamo, scoring seven goals in 24 appearances en route.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrsport.net/vijesti/397113/nogomet-1-hnl/tuzno-dinamovo-slavlje/|title=Tužno Dinamovo slavlje|date=13 May 2010|publisher=HRSport|access-date=10 December 2014}}</ref> He also made five appearances in the [[2009–10 Croatian Football Cup|2009–10 Croatian Cup]] and scored four goals, and made five appearances in [[UEFA]] competitions. The following season turned out to be disappointing for Kramarić, however. With the arrival of new coach [[Vahid Halilhodžić]], Kramarić was mostly used as a late substitute, rarely being used as a match starter. He managed to collect less than 600 minutes of playing time in 17 appearances he made throughout the [[2010–11 GNK Dinamo Zagreb season|2010–11 season]], scoring five goals in process. Despite the personal struggle, he won the [[2010–11 Croatian First Football League|league]] and [[2010–11 Croatian Football Cup|cup]] double with his team.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrsport.net/vijesti/418307/nogomet-kup/dinamu-u-varazdinu-dvostruka-kruna/|title=Dinamu u Varaždinu dvostruka kruna|date=25 May 2011|publisher=HRSport|access-date=8 December 2014}}</ref>

In the first half of the [[2011–12 GNK Dinamo Zagreb season|2011–12 season]], Kramarić's status in the club did not change, as he collected only three appearances before the winter break, and the speculations about him leaving the club started to rise.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kramarić gubi vrijeme, Čačić ga moli da ide na posudbu: 'Nećeš dobiti puno šansi'|url=http://sportske.jutarnji.hr/cacic-zeli-kramarica-dati-na-posudbu/1005474/|website=sportske.jutarnji.hr|publisher=Sportske novosti|access-date=11 November 2014}}</ref> In February 2012, it was announced that Kramarić would be loaned to Prva HNL team [[NK Lokomotiva|Lokomotiva]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Odlazak iz modre svlačionice!

====Lokomotiva Zagreb====
In February 2012, Kramarić was loaned to Lokomotiva until the end of the [[2011–12 Croatian First Football League|season]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hrsport.net/vijesti/434121/nogomet-1-hnl/kramaric-poslan-na-posudbu |title=Kramarić poslan na posudbu |last=Piršljin |first=Josip |date=9 February 2012 |work=Sportnet.hr |language=hr |access-date=9 February 2012}}</ref> At Lokomotiva, he became one of the most proficient strikers in [[Southeast Europe]], scoring 20 goals in 44 league appearances in the season-and-a-half he spent with the ''Lokosi''. In his first full [[2012–13 Croatian First Football League|season]] with Lokomotiva, he finished runner-up to [[Leon Benko]] in the Prva HNL top goalscorer race with 15 goals. He also helped his team reach the [[2012–13 Croatian Football Cup|Croatian Cup]] [[2013 Croatian Football Cup Final|final]] in where they were defeated by [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrsport.net/vijesti/461711/nogomet-kup/hajduk-je-osvajac-kupa-splicani-odigrali-neodluceno-s-lokomotivom-i-s-ukupnih-54-osvojili-trofej/|title=Hajduk je osvajač Kupa!

====Return to Dinamo Zagreb====
There was great excitement when Kramarić returned to Dinamo Zagreb at the start of the [[2013–14 GNK Dinamo Zagreb season|2013–14 season]], with many pundits predicting that he would become the ruthless striker Dinamo had been lacking in recent years. He started his returning season coming on as a late substitute in a [[2013 Croatian Football Super Cup|Croatian Supercup]] match where Dinamo secured their first trophy of the season by defeating Hajduk Split on [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalties]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrsport.net/vijesti/463558/nogomet-kup/dinamo-tek-nakon-lutrije-penala-porazio-hajduk-i-osvojio-superkup/|title=Foto/video: Dinamo tek nakon lutrije penala porazio Hajduk i osvojio Superkup|date=6 July 2013|publisher=HRSport|access-date=8 December 2014}}</ref> But things for Kramarić did not go very well, as he found himself once again on the bench. He quickly became discouraged and complained to the press about his lack of playing time.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kramarić u Koprivnici poručio Mamiću: 'Ako ne računate na mene, onda me pustite!'|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/kramaric-u-koprivnici-porucio-mamicu---ako-ne-racunate-na-mene--onda-me-pustite--/1122076/|website=jutarnji.hr|access-date=19 December 2014}}</ref> This did not bode well with club director [[Zoran Mamić]], who decided to put the young star on the transfer list.<ref>{{cite web|title=Zoran Mamić poručio Kramariću da potraži novi klub: 'Naštetio je Dinamu uoči utakmice u Beču'|url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/zasto-kramaric-mora-biti-zrtva-spavanja-karijere-beqiraja--zdravko-mamic-promijenio-je-plan/1122182/|website=jutarnji.hr|access-date=19 December 2014}}</ref>

===Rijeka===
[[HNK Rijeka|Rijeka]] were the quickest to react to the falling out between Kramarić and Dinamo, securing his services on 31 August 2013. Kramarić debuted for the team on 15 September, playing in the starting line-up in a [[2013–14 Croatian First Football League|Prva HNL]] league match against [[NK Slaven Belupo|Slaven Belupo]], in which he also scored his first goal for the team in the 15th minute, the match's only goal. During a [[2013–14 Croatian Football Cup|Croatian Cup]] match, Kramarić scored eight goals against [[BŠK Zmaj]]. In November 2013, he scored an astonishing goal against [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] in the [[2013–14 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] group stage.<ref>{{cite web|title=Kako je Dinamovo dijete Kramarić proslavilo Rijeku|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/kako-je-dinamovo-dijete-kramaric-proslavilo-rijeku-901668|publisher=Večernji list|access-date=19 December 2013}}</ref> He scored his first hat-trick of the [[2013–14 HNK Rijeka season|season]] against [[NK Istra 1961|Istra 1961]] in a match that ended 3–3, with Kramarić also missing a penalty.<ref>{{cite web|title=Andrej Kramarić zabio tri gola i promašio penal za novi remi|url=http://www.24sata.hr/nogomet/kramaric-zabio-tri-gola-i-promasio-penal-za-remi-protiv-istre-344492|publisher=24sata|access-date=19 December 2013}}</ref> He then netted another goal against Rijeka's [[Adriatic derby|arch rivals]] Hajduk Split at the [[Stadion Poljud]]. Kramarić finished his first season with Rijeka by winning the [[2014 Croatian Football Cup Final|Croatian Cup]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrsport.net/vijesti/472896/nogomet-kup/dinamo-pao-bez-ispaljenog-metka-rijeka-osvojila-kup/|title=Video: Dinamo pao bez ispaljenog metka, Rijeka osvojila Kup|date=13 May 2014|publisher=HRSport|access-date=8 December 2014}}</ref> and scoring 27 goals in all competitions.
In July 2014, just before the start of the new season, Kramarić won the [[2014 Croatian Football Super Cup|Croatian Supercup]] when Rijeka defeated his former club and reigning champions Dinamo Zagreb.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rijeka je osvojila Superkup nakon potpune dominacije protiv Dinama!|url=http://www.vecernji.hr/nogomet/rijeka-i-dinamo-na-kantridi-u-lovu-na-prvi-trofej-u-novoj-sezoni-950001|access-date=1 August 2014|publisher=Večernji List}}</ref>

Kramarić opened the [[2014–15 Croatian First Football League|new season]] of the Prva HNL by scoring five goals in the opening two matches, including a hat-trick against Hajduk Split.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rijeka uzela sve što je Hajduk ponudio i uz hat-trick Kramarića razbila Splićane!|url=http://www.index.hr/sport/clanak/rijeka-uzela-sve-sto-je-hajduk-ponudio-i-uz-hattrick-kramarica-razbila-splicane/762278.aspx|website=index.hr|access-date=1 August 2014}}</ref> By the end of October 2014, he had already scored more than 20 goals in all competitions,<ref>{{cite web|title=Europa ima novu zvijezdu: nezaustavljivi Kramarić u 23 utakmice zabio 22 gola|url=http://www.index.hr/sport/clanak/europa-ima-novu-zvijezdu-nezaustavljivi-kramaric-u-23-utakmice-zabio-22-gola-/779524.aspx|website=index.hr|access-date=28 October 2014}}</ref> including a hat-trick in a [[2014–15 UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] match against [[Feyenoord]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Kantrida u deliriju: Veličanstvena partija Andreja Kramarića!|url=http://gol.dnevnik.hr/clanak/nogomet/rijeka-feyenoord-rijeka-lovi-pobjedu-protiv-nizozemskog-velikana---357806.html|website=gol.hr|access-date=28 October 2014}}</ref> On 9 November, Kramarić scored five goals against [[NK Lokomotiva|Lokomotiva]] in a home match that ended 6–0, a feat that was entered into league annals—for 14 years, no player had scored more than four goals in one match, and in history only two other players have managed to score that number.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rijeka 'šesticom' razbila Lokose!
