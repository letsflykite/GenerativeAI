During his [[Scout (sport)|scouting]] process, as he returned home from school, Mendes realised he was being followed by a man. For fear of being robbed, he ran home, located in a very poor neighbourhood; the "stalker" was actually a Sporting scout, who later convinced him to sign.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.goal.com/br/not%C3%ADcias/Quando-o-sporting-bateu-a-porta-de-nuno-mendes-nao-era/1727kdavveroo1l4rrlcdtqqgr|title=Quando o Sporting bateu à porta de Nuno Mendes: não era assalto, era oportunidade de vida|trans-title=When Sporting knocked on Nuno Mendes's door: it wasn't a robbery, it was a chance for life|publisher=Goal|first=Bruno|last=Andrade|language=pt|date=8 January 2021|access-date=29 September 2021}}</ref> He spent the next four years making a two-hour round trip in order to train every night with his teacher, before moving to Sporting's academy at the age of 14.<ref name=Skills/>

===Sporting CP===
Following the outbreak of the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] in February, which brought a premature end to the youth football season, Mendes was one of a small group of youth players to be called up to the first team by manager [[Rúben Amorim]], despite having only played once since November due to an injury.<ref name=Skills/> He made his professional debut in a 1–0 [[Primeira Liga]] home win against [[F.C.

==Style of play==
Known mainly for his offensive capabilities, speed, and technical qualities, Mendes plays mainly as a left-sided attacking full-back or [[Defender (association football)#Wing-back|wing-back]], which allows him to create danger either from a standing start or whilst on the counter-attack. Apart from his dribbling, he boasts an excellent [[Cross (association football)|crossing]] ability whether tightly marked or open in space, and his physical prowess allows him to beat out opponents to the ball either with his speed or strength. He is also capable of anticipating attacks and cutting in front of a pass and winning the ball back.<ref name=BTL>{{cite web|url=https://breakingthelines.com/player-analysis/player-analysis-nuno-mendes/|title=Player analysis: Nuno Mendes|publisher=Breaking The Lines|first=Jaime|last=Silva|date=17 April 2021|access-date=1 November 2021}}</ref>

Despite his ability going forward, however, the defensive side of Mendes's game has been brought into question by pundits on occasion, who have cited the inconsistency on his decision-making in front of goal, positioning and awareness as areas of weakness in need of improvement.<ref name=BTL/>
