He made his first-team debut in a [[Taça de Portugal]] game in October 2017. After making eight appearances for Porto, he joined Manchester United in June 2018 for a reported fee of €22&nbsp;million (£19&nbsp;million). From October 2020 to June 2021, Dalot was loaned to Italian [[Serie A]] club [[A.C. Milan|Milan]].

Dalot was a [[Portugal national youth football team|youth international]] and represented Portugal from [[Portugal national under-15 football team|under-15]] to [[Portugal national under-21 football team|under-21]] level. He was a member of the [[Portugal national under-17 football team|under-17]] squad that won the [[2016 UEFA European Under-17 Championship]].

==Club career==
===Porto===
Born in [[Braga]], Dalot joined [[FC Porto|Porto]]'s youth system in 2008, aged nine.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.maisfutebol.iol.pt/p-s-para-seguir/nuno-travassos/dalot-o-vaivem-minhoto |title=Dalot, o vaivém minhoto|trans-title=Dalot, the whirlwind from Minho |publisher=Maisfutebol |language=pt |last=Travassos |first=Nuno |date=3 June 2016 |access-date=7 June 2017}}</ref> On 28 January 2017, he made his senior debut with [[FC Porto B|the B team]], playing the full 90 minutes in a 2–1 home loss against [[Leixões S.C.|Leixões]] for the [[LigaPro]] championship.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fcporto.pt/pt/noticias/pages/fc-porto-b-leix%C3%B5es-24a-jornada-ledman-ligapro-1617.aspx |title="Bês" perdem na receção ao Leixões|trans-title=B's host Leixões and lose |publisher=FC Porto |language=pt |date=28 January 2017 |access-date=7 June 2017}}</ref>

===Manchester United===
====2018–20: First seasons in Manchester====
Dalot signed for [[Premier League]] club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] on 6 June 2018 on a five-year contract for a fee of £19&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44380881 |title=Diogo Dalot: Manchester United sign Porto right-back for £19m |first=Simon |last=Stone |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 June 2018 |access-date=6 June 2018}}</ref> Upon his arrival in [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester]], coach [[José Mourinho]] said that, considering his young age, he was one of the best right-backs around.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Mourinho: Dalot is Europe's best full-back in his age group|date=6 June 2018 |url=https://www.fourfourtwo.com/news/mourinho-dalot-europes-best-full-back-his-age-group}}</ref> He made his debut on 19 September 2018 in an away [[UEFA Champions League]] group stage match against Swiss side [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]],<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/45578863 |title=Man Utd: Diogo Dalot could be at club for 10 years - Jose Mourinho |publisher=BBC Sport |date=19 September 2018}}</ref> but was unable to have continuity in the team due to an injury sustained in the previous season.

During that season, he had a memorable match in Paris, in the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] round of 16 2nd leg against [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]], where Manchester United completed a remarkable comeback due to a late penalty, won after a shot by Dalot.<ref>{{Cite web|title=PSG-Manchester United 1-3, gol e highlights.

During his first seasons for the club, Dalot struggled with various injuries and following the arrival of [[Aaron Wan-Bissaka]], his performances were severely limited under manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer.<ref name="Career">{{Cite news |first=Charlotte|last=Duncker|title=Dalot slept at AC Milan training ground to help resurrect Man Utd career |url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/dalot-slept-training-ground-resurrect-man-utd-career/17za9b48h3gnb1i5p9rv736iow|website=Goal |date=29 September 2021|access-date=29 September 2021}}</ref>

====2020–21: Loan to Milan====
Following sporadic use by Manchester United, Dalot was loaned to Italian [[Serie A]] side [[A.C.

During the season, Dalot's versatility enabled him to play either as a [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right back]] and [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|left back]]. This made him an integral part of [[Stefano Pioli]]'s team, helping Milan secure second place in the [[2020–21 Serie A]] and qualification for the [[2021–22 UEFA Champions League]] after an eight-year absence.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.football-italia.net/171087/atalanta-0-2-milan-kessie-seals-second-place |title=Atalanta 0-2 Milan: Kessie seals second place |website=football-italia.net |date=23 May 2021 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/transfer-news/man-utd-dalot-ac-milan-24596333|title=Man Utd issue Diogo Dalot transfer demand to ensure history doesn't repeat itself |website=Mirror|date=22 July 2021}}</ref> During his spell as a ''Rossonero'', he was able to play regularly, making 33 appearances, scoring two goals and providing three assists. As often said by Dalot himself, in Italy he was able to improve defensively, without losing his ability to attack.<ref>{{Cite web|title=Dalot: "Grazie al Milan ora sono più completo.
