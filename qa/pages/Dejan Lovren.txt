Lovren began his career at [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]] before moving to Lyon in January 2010. He spent three-and-a-half seasons with the [[Ligue 1]] team and won the [[2012 Coupe de France Final|2012 Coupe de France]] before he signed for [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]] in 2013. After one season with Southampton, he joined [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] for £20&nbsp;million. He went on to make 185 appearances for the club, winning the [[UEFA Champions League]] in [[2019 UEFA Champions League Final|2019]] and the [[Premier League]] in [[2019–20 Premier League|2020]], before joining [[2019–20 Russian Premier League|Russian champions]] [[FC Zenit Saint Petersburg|Zenit Saint Petersburg]] in July 2020. Within four months, he became the captain of the team, replacing [[Artem Dzyuba]].

Having previously represented [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] at various youth levels, Lovren made his senior debut in 2009 and went on to make over 70 appearances for his country.

===Lyon===
[[File:Dejan Lovren.jpg|thumb|upright|Lovren playing for [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] in 2010]]

In January 2010, Lovren signed for French [[Ligue 1]] club [[Olympique Lyonnais]] for €8&nbsp;million plus €1.5&nbsp;million in incentives on a four-and-a-half-year contract.<ref>{{cite web |title=Reference Document 2008/09 |url=http://www.actusnews.com/documents/ACTUS-0-3288-OL-DDR-0809-GB.pdf |publisher=Actusnews Wire |access-date=15 June 2013 |page=101 }}</ref> He made his competitive debut on 24 January 2010 in their 2–1 defeat to [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]] in the [[2009–10 Coupe de France|Coupe de France]], playing the full match.

During the second half of the season, he made 10 appearances, mostly as a substitute. He was not allowed to participate in Lyon's matches in the UEFA Champions League that season as he had already played in the competition for Dinamo Zagreb.{{fact|date=March 2022}}

Lovren's playing time increased during the [[2010–11 Olympique Lyonnais season|2010–11 season]] following the departure of two other defenders, [[Jean-Alain Boumsong]] and [[Mathieu Bodmer]], in the summer of 2010. During the season, he gradually established himself as a first team regular starter, playing as a [[centre-back]] alongside [[Cristiano Marques Gomes|Cris]] as well as being used as a right or left full-back, demonstrating himself as a versatile defender.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tribalfootball.com/articles/support-inside-barcelona-lyon-defender-lovren-increasing-3422641 |title=Support inside Barcelona for Lyon defender Lovren increasing |year=2012 |website=Tribal Football |access-date=15 November 2016}}</ref> In November 2010 Lovren was listed in the ''[[Don Balón]]'' list of the 100 best young players in the world.<ref>{{cite web |title=Don Balon's list of the 100 best young players in the world |url=http://www.thespoiler.co.uk/2010/11/02/don-balons-list-of-the-100-best-young-players-in-the-world/ |publisher=Don Balón |date=2 November 2010 |access-date=9 April 2013}}</ref>

On 23 January 2012, Lovren extended his contract with Lyon for two more seasons, signing with the French club until 2016.
