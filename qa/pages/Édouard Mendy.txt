'''Édouard Osoque Mendy''' (born 1 March 1992) is a professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Saudi Professional League]] club [[Al Ahli Saudi FC|Al Ahli]]. Born in France, he plays for the [[Senegal national football team|Senegal national team]].

Starting his career in his native France, Mendy played in the [[Le Havre AC|Le Havre]] academy before signing professional terms with third division [[AS Cherbourg Football|Cherbourg]] in 2011. Mendy was released in 2014, after which he almost quit football, before getting an opportunity with [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]]'s reserves. He established himself as regular in the following seasons at [[Stade de Reims|Reims]] and [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]].

In September 2020, Mendy signed for [[Premier League]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] for a reported fee of £22&nbsp;million. In his first season, he immediately broke into the starting line-up, becoming the first African goalkeeper to play for the club's senior team, and kept sixteen clean sheets in the Premier League. Mendy also equalled the record for the most clean sheets in a [[2020–21 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] season with nine, and kept another clean sheet in the [[2021 UEFA Champions League Final|final]] to help Chelsea win their second title. He was also awarded both the [[Best European Goalkeeper|UEFA Goalkeeper of the Year]] and [[The Best FIFA Goalkeeper]] of 2021, becoming the first African goalkeeper in football's history to win both awards. 

Eligible to play for [[Guinea-Bissau national football team|Guinea-Bissau]], Senegal, and [[France national football team|France]], Mendy initially joined Guinea-Bissau in honour of his father. However, he subsequently switched allegiance to Senegal, where he became the first choice keeper for the [[2019 Africa Cup of Nations]], helping Senegal to a runners-up finish. He helped his nation win the [[2021 Africa Cup of Nations]], while also being named the tournament's [[2021 Africa Cup of Nations#Awards|best goalkeeper]], keeping a clean sheet in the [[2021 Africa Cup of Nations Final|final]].
