==Club career==
===Nordsjælland===
Kudus arrived at Danish club [[FC Nordsjælland|Nordsjælland]] from the Ghanaian [[Right to Dream Academy]], which he joined at the age of 10, in January 2018 together with two teammates, [[Ibrahim Sadiq]] and Gideon Mensah.<ref>[https://sn.dk/Sport-FAA/U17-landsholdsspillere-paa-vej/artikel/708492 U17-landsholdsspillere på vej], sn.dk, 10 December 2017</ref>

Kudus made his official debut for Nordsjælland only three days after his 18th birthday, in a 2–0 defeat against [[Brøndby IF]].
