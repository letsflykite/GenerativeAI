'''Al-Janoub Stadium''' ({{lang-ar|استاد الجنوب|ʾIstād al-Janūb|Stadium of the South}}),<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.the-afc.com/en/national/fifa_world_cup/news/al_janoub_stadium_opens_to_fanfare.html|title=Al Janoub Stadium opens to fanfare|website=the-AFC}}</ref> formerly known as '''Al-Wakrah Stadium''' ({{Lang-ar|استاد الوكرة}}), is a [[retractable roof]] [[association football|football]] stadium in [[Al-Wakrah]], [[Qatar]] that was inaugurated on 16 May 2019. This was the second among the eight stadiums for the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Qatar]], after the renovation of [[Khalifa International Stadium]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/17/05/2019/Amir-inaugurates-Al-Janoub-Stadium |title=Amir inaugurates Al Janoub Stadium |publisher=thepeninsulaqatar.com |date=17 May 2019 |accessdate=22 March 2022}}</ref> It was designed by Iraqi-British architect [[Zaha Hadid]] (1950–2016) together with the firms [[AECOM]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.zaha-hadid.com/architecture/al-wakrah-stadium/ |title=Al Janoub Stadium |publisher=zaha-hadid.com |date= |accessdate=24 August 2021}},</ref> and Jain and Partners of [[Dubai]].{{cn|date=November 2022}}

The stadium features a curvilinear [[Postmodern architecture|postmodernist]] and [[Neo-futurism|neo-futurist]] design. The appearance of the roof was inspired by the sails of traditional [[Dhow]] boats, used by pearl divers from the region, weaving through currents of the [[Persian Gulf]].<ref name="sc.qa2">{{cite web|url=http://www.sc.qa/en/stadiums/al-wakrah-stadium/design |title=Al Wakrah Stadium Design |publisher=sc.qa |date= |accessdate=24 March 2022 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190505114225/http://www.sc.qa/en/stadiums/al-wakrah-stadium/design |archivedate=5 May 2019 }}</ref>

On 8 September 2020, [[Qatar]] introduced migrant reforms in the country that are applied to workers of all sections, regardless of their nationality. According to Qatar's new labor reforms, workers must be paid a basic minimum wage which must not be less than 1000 riyals. Workers who are provided with only accommodation and no food facilities must be entitled to food allowances (300 riyals) with their basic wage. Moreover, Qatar introduced a wage protection system to ensure that the employers are complying with the reforms and to help, guide and protect the rights of labours. An occupational safety and health policy was adopted by the MOL and the public health to ensure more strategic coordinated and data-driven approaches. Qatar has taken a wide range of measures to improve protections for workers in Qatar which are recognized by independent experts from the [[International Labour Organization]] and international unions.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Qatar World Cup: Calls for FIFA to contribute to compensation scheme for workers in host country receive strong support |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11095/12697539/qatar-world-cup-calls-for-fifa-to-contribute-to-compensation-scheme-for-workers-in-host-country-receive-strong-support |access-date=2022-10-25 |website=Sky Sports |language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-04-07 |title=Overview of Qatar's labour reforms |url=http://www.ilo.org/beirut/countries/qatar/qatar-office/WCMS_760466/lang--en/index.htm |access-date=2022-10-25 |website=www.ilo.org |language=en}}</ref> 

==Design==
[[File:Al Wakrah Stadium construction 2019.jpg|thumb|The stadium's facade near completion. January 2019.]]
The stadium was designed by the architect Zaha Hadid, and her architectural firm, [[Zaha Hadid Architects]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/90351700/see-the-first-photos-of-zaha-hadids-controversial-world-cup-stadium-here |title=See the first photos of Zaha Hadid's controversial World Cup stadium here |publisher=fastcompany.com |date=21 May 2019 |accessdate=16 August 2021}}</ref> Zaha Hadid Architects stated that “The stadium was designed in conjunction with a new precinct so that it sits at the heart of an urban extension of the city, creating community-based activities in and around the stadium on non-event days.”<ref>{{cite web|url=https://inhabitat.com/zaha-hadids-2022-world-cup-stadium-in-qatar-adapts-for-future-use/ |title=Zaha Hadid's 2022 World Cup stadium in Qatar adapts for future use |publisher=inhabitat.com |date=21 May 2019 |accessdate=28 March 2022 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20211020113535/https://inhabitat.com/zaha-hadids-2022-world-cup-stadium-in-qatar-adapts-for-future-use/ |archivedate=20 October 2021 }}</ref>

The cooling system prevents the stadium's users from overheating, due to [[Geography of Qatar|Qatar's hot and arid climate]]. It is capable of cooling the spectator areas to 18°C and the field of play to 20°C.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.qatar2022.qa/en/news/the-mastermind-behind-qatar-2022s-air-cooled-stadiums |title=The mastermind behind Qatar 2022's air-cooled stadiums |publisher=qatar2022.qa |date=16 December 2019 |accessdate=6 April 2022}}</ref> According to Qatar's Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy (SC), "detailed micro-climate analysis informed the arena's shape, with aerodynamics and optimal shading from the roof, which incorporates a minimal amount of glass, making a significant contribution to temperature control."<ref name="qatar2022.qa4" />

==Facilities==
The sports complex includes a multipurpose room, with swimming pools and spas and a shopping center with green roofs. The entrance to the stadium will be on a wooded square.

A school, wedding hall, cycling, horse riding and running tracks, restaurants, marketplaces and gyms within the vicinity are planned to be built to accompany Al Janoub Stadium.<ref name="qatar2022.qa4" />

==Proposed renovations==
After the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], Al Janoub Stadium is the [[Al-Wakrah SC]]'s home, instead of the current [[Saoud bin Abdulrahman Stadium]]. The seating capacity has been halved from 40,000 to 20,000 and is used for [[Qatar Stars League]] matches.<ref name=″daily2″ /> Qatar Supreme Committee for Delivery & Legacy has claimed that the remaining half of the stadium's seats will be donated to developing countries in need of sporting infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.floornature.com/zaha-hadid-architects-al-janoub-stadium-al-wakrah-qatar-14760/ |title=Zaha Hadid Architects Al Janoub Stadium Wakrah, Qatar |publisher=floornature.com |date=14 June 2019 |accessdate=19 August 2021}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gdnonline.com/Details/120084/2022-FIFA-World-Cup-French-delegation-praises-Al-Wakrah-stadium |title=2022 FIFA World Cup: French delegation praises Al-Wakrah stadium |publisher=gdnonline.com |date=21 October 2016 |accessdate=6 April 2022}}</ref>
