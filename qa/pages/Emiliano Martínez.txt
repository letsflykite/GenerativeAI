Martínez created controversy after winning the Golden Glove during the 2022 FIFA World Cup award ceremony; he put the trophy to his groin and pointed towards the audience, and then emphatically waved it in the air. It generated a stir, and some media outlets reported that he had made a vulgar gesture. Addressing this, Martinez said he had done this gesture due to the French fans booing him. He also led a [[conga line]] of Argentine players at the locker room making fun of French player [[Kylian Mbappé]].<ref>{{cite web |author=<!--Not stated--> |date=23 December 2022 |title=Emiliano Martinez celebrations: Aston Villa boss Unai Emery to speak to goalkeeper |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64082346 |access-date=24 December 2022 |website=[[BBC News]] |publisher=[[BBC Sport]]}}</ref> During the celebrations in [[Buenos Aires]], fans presented him with a baby-doll with the face of Mbappé.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-12-20 |title=Una locura más de Dibu Martínez: agarró un bebé de juguete que tenía la imagen de Mbappé y festejó al lado de Messi.

==Personal life==
Martínez was given the names "Damián Emiliano" on his birth certificate, which caused confusion when he signed for Arsenal and everyone at the club was calling him Damián. "My name was actually going to be Emiliano Damian on my Argentinian ID," Martínez later explained. "[B]ut when my mum went to do it in the post office, I don't know where she done it, she was waiting hours and hours in the queue and when they done it they put Damian Emiliano first. To do it again she would have to wait two, three hours so she went 'it's ok, just do it like that, we're going to call him Emi anyway'. It was a bit confusing but now everyone calls me Emi. Damian used to be my grandad's middle name. My mum [originally] wanted just two names - Emiliano Martinez - but because my grandad passed away before I was born she wanted to put Damian in between the two names to have my grandad's name, nothing else."<ref>{{cite web |title=Arsenal goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez explains Damien name confusion |url=https://onefootball.com/en/news/arsenal-goalkeeper-emiliano-martinez-explains-damien-name-confusion-30586082 |date=31 July 2020 |access-date=26 March 2023 |website=OneFootball |language=en}}</ref>

He is nicknamed "Dibu" (abbreviation of ''Dibujo'', Spanish for ''Drawing''), after an animated character in the Argentine [[telenovela]] ''[[Mi familia es un dibujo]]''. Martinez was given the nickname as a young player by former goalkeeper and goalkeeper coach [[Miguel Ángel Santoro]] at Independiente, at a time when the series was highly popular.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://pasenyvean.cadena3.com/noticia.asp?categoria=pasen-y-vean&titulo=dibu-la-serie-que-inspiro-el-apodo-de-emiliano-martinez&id=297565 |title="Dibu", la serie que inspiró el apodo de Emiliano Martínez|trans-title="Dibu", the series that inspired the nickname of Emiliano Martínez |website=Pasen y Vean |date=7 July 2021 |access-date=28 January 2022 |language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |date=2022-12-15 |title=Peta: "El apodo 'Dibu' se lo puso Pepé Santoro porque se parecía al protagonista de 'Mi familia es un dibujo' - AM 530 - Somos Radio |url=https://am530somosradio.com/peta-el-apodo-dibu-se-lo-puso-pepe-santoro-porque-se-parecia-al-protagonista-de-mi-familia-es-un-dibujo/ |access-date=2022-12-21 |language=es}}</ref>

The couple have a son, Santi, and a daughter, Ava.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.clarin.com/deportes/mandinha-mujer-dibu-martinez-nuevo-heroe-seleccion_0_bYkEX4BJs.html |newspaper=[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]] |title=Quién es Mandinha, la mujer de Dibu Martínez, el nuevo héroe de la Selección |date=7 July 2021|access-date=14 February 2022 |language=es}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.infobae.com/deportes/2021/07/15/la-historia-de-amor-de-emiliano-martinez-y-su-esposa-mandinha-como-se-conocieron-y-los-famosos-que-fueron-al-casamiento/ |newspaper=Infobae |title=La historia de amor de Emiliano Martínez y su esposa Mandinha: cómo se conocieron y los famosos que fueron al casamiento |last=Gatti |first=Lucas |date=15 July 2021|access-date=14 February 2022 |language=es}}</ref>

On 22 December 2022, after winning the 2022 FIFA World Cup with the national team, Martínez was given a welcome reception at Las Toscas resort, in his native city of Mar del Plata. According to the local press, there was an attendance of more than 150,000 people, both locals and tourists.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Olé |first=Diario Deportivo |date=2022-12-22 |title=Multitudinario homenaje al Dibu Martínez en Mar del Plata: "Ahora quiero ganar la cuarta" |url=https://www.ole.com.ar/seleccion/mar-del-plata-homenaje-dibu-martinez_0_McMVAmCgRw.html |access-date=2022-12-23 |website=Olé |language=es}}</ref>
