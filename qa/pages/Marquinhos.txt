==Style of play==
[[File:Thiago Silva & Marquinhos.jpg|thumb|upright|Marquinhos (right) has been likened to [[Thiago Silva]] (left), who was his club and international teammate.]]
In terms of his playing position, Marquinhos is predominantly deployed as a [[Defender (association football)#Centre-back|central defender]], but has also been used at [[Defender (association football)#Full-back|right-back]] and in a [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central]] or [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|defensive midfield]] role.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Johnson|first1=Jonathan|title=Where Will Marquinhos Fit in at PSG?|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1710171-where-will-marquinhos-fit-in-at-psg|access-date=22 March 2016|publisher=Bleacher Report|date=19 July 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Muthanna|first1=Pradhan|title=Manchester United: PSG defender Marquinhos not interested in leaving Paris|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/manchester-united-psg-defender-marquinhos-not-interested-leaving-paris-1496700|access-date=22 March 2016|work=International Business Times|date=16 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/soccer/blog/marcottis-musings/62/post/3613672/arsenal-emery-have-to-deal-with-ozil-mess-juve-clicking-into-gear-more |title=Arsenal, Emery have to deal with Ozil mess; Juve clicking into gear; more |publisher=ESPN FC |last1=Marcotti |first1=Gabriele |date=27 August 2018 |access-date=4 February 2019 }}</ref> He is noted for his anticipation, pace, and intelligence, as well as his technical skills, composure, passing ability, elegance on the ball, and confidence in possession, which enables him to break down attacks and subsequently play the ball out or start offensive plays from the back.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.squawka.com/en/news/marquinhos-the-story-behind-the-psg-defenders-golden-boy-nomination/223780#kr7tuAt4KAwR9Ux8.97 |title=Marquinhos: The story behind the PSG defender's Golden Boy nomination |publisher=squawka.com |author1=Daniel Anwar |date=20 November 2014 |access-date=9 October 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2017/05/09/top-25-best-defenders-world/marquinhos/ |title=The top 25 best defenders in the world |work=The Telegraph|date=9 May 2017 |access-date=9 October 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.eurosport.com/football/who-is-teenager-marquinhos-the-fifth-most-expensive-defender-in-history_sto4716669/story.shtml |title=Who is teenager Marquinhos, the fifth most expensive defender in history? |publisher=Eurosport |date=20 July 2013 |access-date=9 October 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://vivoperlei.calciomercato.com/articolo/marquinhos-o-de-vrij-dopo-bonucci |title=Juve, il dopo Bonucci è adesso: Marquinhos o De Vrij? |publisher=calciomercato.com |language=it |date=6 June 2017 |access-date=4 February 2019 }}</ref>

On signing for Roma, Marquinhos described himself as a quick player, with a good positional sense, who wins back a lot of balls, and who can impose himself on a game due to his ability to start attacking plays from the back. He named Thiago Silva as his role model.<ref name=voce/> In March 2015, Marquinhos told ''[[FourFourTwo]]'' that he compensated for his average height for a defender by honing his strength and timing, attributes he learnt from PSG assistant manager [[Claude Makélélé]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Alves|first1=Marcus|title=Marquinhos: I might have played for Portugal, but I'm not looking to England yet|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/marquinhos-i-might-have-played-portugal-im-not-looking-england-yet#:NGSpfU9pkWXNzA|access-date=12 November 2015|work=FourFourTwo|date=11 March 2015}}</ref> He praised manager Laurent Blanc, a former defender himself, for encouraging the PSG defenders to attack in [[Set piece (football)|set pieces]] and teaching them the correct positioning in that situation.<ref name=blanc/>

Fellow Roma defender Nicolás Burdisso said in August 2012 that Marquinhos was "a little phenomenon. He has speed, heading ability, he knows what to do, he is humble. He is a little Thiago Silva".<ref>{{cite news|title=BURDISSO: "Con l'Inter una Roma tosta. Castan è un leader. Marquinhos?

In January 2014, Marquinhos was named by British newspaper ''[[The Observer]]'' as one of the ten most promising young players in Europe. They wrote, "He has the temperament to remain undaunted, the talent to succeed, and could benefit from playing alongside his club team-mate, Thiago Silva, with whom he enjoys a solid understanding at wealthy Paris Saint-Germain."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jan/19/next-10-big-things-europes-top-youngsters|title=The next 10 big things: Europe's top youngsters and stars of the future|date=18 January 2014|work=The Guardian}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In May 2015, Marquinhos told ''[[Le Parisien]]'' that he had become engaged to Brazilian singer and reality television contestant Carol Cabrino. He proposed to her underneath the [[Eiffel Tower]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Marquinhos (PSG) fiancé à sa belle Carol : "On est très heureux ensemble"|trans-title=Marquinhos (PSG) becomes engaged to his beautiful Carol: "We are very happy together"|url=http://www.purepeople.com/article/marquinhos-psg-fiance-a-sa-belle-carol-on-est-tres-heureux-ensemble_a159342/1|access-date=22 March 2016|publisher=Purepeople|date=9 May 2015|language=fr}}</ref> They had a civil wedding in June 2016.<ref>{{cite news|title=Marquinhos, do PSG, e a cantora Carol Cabrino se casam no civil|trans-title=Marquinhos, of PSG, and singer Carol Cabrno have a civil wedding|url=https://extra.globo.com/esporte/marquinhos-do-psg-a-cantora-carol-cabrino-se-casam-no-civil-19606660.html|access-date=8 June 2017|work=Jornal Extra|date=29 June 2016|language=pt}}</ref> Their daughter was born on 1 November 2017, with Cabrino having gone early into labour while watching Marquinhos playing a Champions League match against [[R.S.C.

During a match between PSG and [[FC Nantes|Nantes]] on 14 March 2021, Marquinhos' parents were held hostage in a robbery.
