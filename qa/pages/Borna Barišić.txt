== Club career ==
Barišić was born in [[Osijek]] in eastern [[Regions of Croatia|Croatian region]] of [[Slavonia]] to [[Croats of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Croat]] parents. His father Stipe "Moljac" Barišić hails from [[Galečić]], while his mother Verica ({{Nee|Tokić}}) hails from [[Stražbenica (Kupres)|Stražbenica]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=1 February 2020|title=OVO MU JE NAGRADA ZA SVE : Borna Barišić, porijeklom iz duvanjskog kraja, potpisao novi, sjajan ugovor!|url=https://www.tomislavnews.com/ovo-mu-je-nagrada-za-sve-borna-barisic-porijeklom-iz-duvanjskog-kraja-potpisao-novi-sjajni-ugovor/|access-date=25 September 2020|website=Tomislavnews.com|language=hr}}</ref> He joined the youth academy of [[NK Osijek|Osijek]] in 2003, spending eight years with the side. After failing to break into the first team, Barišić moved to nearby [[NK BSK Bijelo Brdo|BSK Bijelo Brdo]].

=== Osijek ===
After a single season with Bijelo Brdo, Barišić returned to Osijek. In his first season with the first team, Barišić managed 23 [[Croatian First Football League|Prva HNL]] appearances, debuting on 12 July 2013 in a 3–1 loss to [[GNK Dinamo Zagreb|Dinamo Zagreb]]. Barišić first goal for Osijek came on 4 April 2014 in the form on an 88th minute winner against [[NK Lokomotiva|Lokomotiva]]. Osijek finished in 8th place in the [[2013–14 Croatian First Football League|2013–14 season]]. The following season, Barišić played in 28 games, managing one goal and two assists from left back as Osijek narrowly avoided relegation.

=== Dinamo Zagreb and Lokomotiva ===
Despite his club's struggles, Barišić's performance for Osijek in the [[2014–15 Croatian First Football League|2014–15 season]] saw him earn a move to league champions Dinamo, signing a five-year contract.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.24sata.hr/sport/barisic-potpisao-je-za-dinamo-ponosan-sam-sto-sam-ovdje-418716|title=Barišić iz Osijeka u Dinamo: Ponosan sam što sam ovdje|access-date=18 October 2018|language=hr}}</ref> Barišić's made his debut for his new club against his former club Osijek on 19 July 2015. In late August, however, Barišić was loaned out to Dinamo's [[Farm team|feeder club]] Lokomotiva. At Lokomotiva, Barišić made 19 league appearances, managing two assists.

=== Return to Osijek ===
Osijek were purchased in February 2016 by Hungarian [[Oligarchy|oligarch]] [[Lőrinc Mészáros]] and Croatian [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]] [[Ivan Meštrović (sportsman)|Ivan Meštrović]], the first time the club had gone into [[Private property|private ownership]]. The new ownership identified Barišić as the type of player they want representing the club; young, talented and produced by the youth academy. Barišić subsequently agreed to the transfer and was appointed captain of his junior club. Barišić made his returning debut for Osijek on 23 July 2016, captaining the club to a 2–0 win over [[NK Inter Zaprešić|Inter Zaprešić]]. Barišić made 32 league appearances, scoring once and assisting seven times as Osijek finished 4th, its highest league finish in nearly 10 years.

In summer 2017, Barišić drew attention from Ukrainian club [[FC Dynamo Kyiv|Dynamo Kyiv]], and he agreed personal terms with the club. However, at the last minute, Dynamo opted for Dinamo Zagreb's [[Josip Pivarić]]. In an interview with ''[[Sportske novosti]]'' on 11 August, Barišić publicly called out Dinamo for sabotaging the transfer.<ref>{{Cite web|last=Ružić|first=Darko|date=11 August 2017|title=KAPETAN OSIJEKA NAKON PROPALOG TRANSFERA U SNAŽNI EUROPSKI KLUB 'Dinamo mi je izminirao transfer da bi prodao Pivarića!

In the [[2017–18 UEFA Europa League]] [[2017–18 UEFA Europa League qualifying phase and play-off round#Third qualifying round|qualifying]], Barišić scored a penalty in a 1–0 away win for Osijek over [[PSV Eindhoven]].
