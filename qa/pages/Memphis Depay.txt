'''Memphis Depay''' ({{IPA-nl|ˈmɛɱfɪz dəˈpɑi}}; born 13 February 1994), also known simply as '''Memphis''',<ref name=things/> is a Dutch professional [[Association football|footballer]] <!-- Don't add 'rapper' or 'musician' --> who plays as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for [[La Liga]] club [[Atlético Madrid]] and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands national team]].

Memphis began his professional career with [[PSV Eindhoven]], where, under the influence of manager [[Phillip Cocu]], he became an integral part of the team, scoring 49 goals in 124 games across all competitions. During the [[2014–15 Eredivisie#Top scorers|2014–15 season]], he was the [[Eredivisie]]'s top scorer with 22 goals in 30 games, and helped the team win the Eredivisie title for the first time since 2008. He also won the [[Dutch Footballer of the Year#Dutch Football Talent of the Year|Dutch Footballer of the Year]] for his performances during the season. His performances also led him to be named the "Best Young Player" in the world in 2015 by ''[[France Football]]''. Memphis joined English side [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in June 2015 for a reported fee of £25 million. After a disappointing spell there, he joined French club [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]] in January 2017. After five seasons there, he joined Barcelona in 2021 on a free transfer.

A product of the [[Royal Dutch Football Association]] (KNVB) institution, Memphis has represented the national team at every professional level from early developmental stages under the tutelage of iconic Dutch coaches and players alike. He was part of the [[Netherlands national under-17 football team|Netherlands under-17 team]] which won the [[2011 UEFA European Under-17 Championship|2011 European Championship]]. He made his senior debut in 2013 and the following year was part of their squad that came third at the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], where he made his breakthrough performances on the international stage. He also took part in [[UEFA Euro 2020]] and the [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cup]].

==Early life==
Memphis Depay was born in the small [[South Holland]] village of [[Moordrecht]] to a Ghanaian father, Dennis Depay, and a Dutch mother, Cora Schensema.<ref name="depay1">{{Cite web |title=Manchester United's Memphis Depay: the dream chaser who defied the odds |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/jul/08/manchester-united-memphis-depay-dream-chaser |last=Ramesh |first=Priya |date=8 July 2015 |website=The Guardian |access-date=13 August 2016}}</ref> It was not long, however, before the relationship between the two parents began to fall apart and when Memphis was four, his father walked out on the family.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/premier-league/memphis-depay-s-father-pleads-with-son-to-end-17year-rift-and-denies-abandoning-him-10489543.html |title=Memphis Depay's father pleads with son to end 17-year rift and denies abandoning him |last=Orr |first=James |date=7 September 2015 |work=The Independent |accessdate=23 May 2022}}</ref>

==Club career==
===PSV Eindhoven===
Memphis impressed football scouts from [[Sparta Rotterdam]] at the age of eight on the fields of his boyhood club Moordrecht. It took only three seasons before scouts from Sparta snatched Memphis from his local club. Club chairman Ton Redegeld said, "Memphis was as a young player already complete. He was two-footed and strong. If we won 7–0, he scored five times and would assist two times".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Residents Moordrecht pride in "their" Memphis Depay: "We lived intensely with him ' |url=http://www.omroepbrabant.nl/?news/2291961183/Amateurclub+Depay+krijgt+geen+cent+na+megatransfer+Wij+moeten+het+hebben+van+een+broodje+Memphis.aspx |website=Omroep Brabant |access-date=13 August 2016}}</ref> When he turned 12, Memphis caught the eye of clubs such as [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]], [[PSV Eindhoven]] and [[Feyenoord]].

==Style of play==
[[File:Memphis Depay.jpg|thumb|Memphis playing for PSV Eindhoven in 2011]]
Early in his career, a PSV coach noted Memphis as "very angry", and he now uses a [[life coach]] to aid his mentality.<ref name=things/> In April 2015, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' described Memphis as "a fearsome striker of the ball with his right foot but is usually used as an [[Inverted Winger|inverted left winger]] who cuts onto his right foot. A pacey and tricky player, his direct running makes him a difficult opponent for defenders".<ref name=things/> However, they criticised him as "a ball-hog", pointing out his high rate of shots in comparison to a low rate of assists.<ref name=things/> Memphis is also known for his [[Direct free kick|free-kick ability]]. During the 2014–15 season, he was statistically the best set-piece taker in the whole of Europe, as he scored 7 times in 33 attempts, the most in all European leagues and the second-best accuracy.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Man United's Memphis Depay is statistically the best free kick taker in Europe |url=http://www.101greatgoals.com/blog/man-uniteds-memphis-depay-is-statistically-the-best-free-kick-taker-in-europe-graphics/ |publisher=101 Great Goals|access-date=4 October 2015|archive-date=4 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304100851/http://www.101greatgoals.com/blog/man-uniteds-memphis-depay-is-statistically-the-best-free-kick-taker-in-europe-graphics/|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=This stat proves Man United's new transfer signing Depay will RULE the Prem&nbsp;... |url=http://metro.co.uk/2015/05/11/manchester-united-signing-memphis-depay-is-the-best-free-kick-taker-in-europe-5191906/ |website=Metro|access-date=4 October 2015 |first=Tom |last=Olver |date=11 May 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Memphis Depay's Free Kick Stats Make Great Reading For Man United Fans |website=Balls.ie |url=http://www.balls.ie/football/00910-memphis-depay-free-kick-stats-man-united-fans/288223 |access-date=4 October 2015 |first=Mikey |last=Traynor}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=A nice little stat to get Manchester United fans excited about Memphis Depay |website=SportsJOE.ie |url=http://www.sportsjoe.ie/football/a-nice-little-stat-to-get-manchester-united-fans-excited-about-memphis-depay/24212|access-date=4 October 2015}}</ref>

Former Dutch international and Dutch national team manager [[Ronald Koeman]] regards Memphis as "a great talent", but says that he must continue his personal development due to the physicality and mental strength needed in the Premier League.<ref name="bbc"/> Former [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] defender [[Arjan de Zeeuw]] stated about Memphis, "People regard him as a little bit arrogant, a little bit cocky, but I think he is a very good player, a very promising player, a very strong, very quick player and he's got some skill."<ref>{{cite news |title=Who is £30m forward Memphis Depay? |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/32627853 |work=BBC Sport|access-date=4 October 2015}}</ref>

Memphis has been compared to former Manchester United player [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] and fellow international [[Arjen Robben]]. Thijs Slegers said about the comparisons, "Memphis is a little bit like Cristiano; they have similar qualities, although there are of course areas where Memphis is inferior. However, his determination to be the best is where I see the real similarity with Cristiano."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Manchester United winger Memphis Depay is 'more like Ronaldo than Robben' |website=[[Daily Mirror]] |date=9 June 2015 |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/manchester-united-winger-memphis-depay-5854102|access-date=4 October 2015}}</ref> Like Ronaldo, Depay combines technical expertise with pure physical strength.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Memphis Depay is a huge talent – but would he suit Liverpool or Man United more? |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/scouting-report-memphis-depay-huge-5557697|access-date=4 October 2015 |first=Elko |last=Born |website=[[Daily Mirror]] |date=21 April 2015}}</ref>

==Musical career==
{{BLP sources section|date=March 2021}}
Memphis began pursuing a hip-hop career in June 2017 when he released his Los Angeles-inspired freestyle, "LA Vibes". The music video featured [[Quincy Promes]], Memphis' teammate at the Netherlands national team. The song's music video earned around 150,000 views within hours of being uploaded to [[YouTube]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=Footballer Memphis Depay releases rap song |date=27 June 2017 |url=http://www.egypttoday.com/Article/8/9036/Footballer-Memphis-Depay-releases-rap-song |publisher=Egypt Today|access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref> In December 2017, Memphis released his freestyle track "Kings & Queens". On 3 October 2018, he collaborated with musical artists [[Winne]] and Nana Fofie and producer Rass King for his Ghana-inspired single, "AKWAABA",<ref>{{cite web |last=Macaluso |first=Massimiliano |title=Memphis Depay, Rapper and Philanthropist |work=NSS Magazine |publisher=NSS Factory |url=http://www.nssmag.com/en/sports/16333/la-nuova-vita-extracalcistica-di-memphis-depay}}</ref> and also released his third freestyle, "Porto Cervo (Interlude)", with Winne. Memphis released his fourth freestyle, "5-mill" in response to his [[Instagram]] account reaching 5&nbsp;million followers. Critics of the freestyle claimed that Memphis' public image was hampered through his cigar-smoking and his careless attitude.<ref>{{cite news |title=Memphis Depay's rap video met with praise and bewilderment online |url=https://www.independent.ie/world-news/and-finally/memphis-depays-rap-video-met-with-praise-and-bewilderment-online-37563995.html |newspaper=The Independent|access-date=8 January 2019}}</ref>

In December 2018, he released his second single, "No Love", over his cancelled engagement with model Lori Harvey. The song is multilingual, switching back and forth between English and Dutch.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/lori-harveys-ex-fianc-drops-music-video-with-no-love-subliminals-news.68073.html |title=Lori Harvey's Ex-Fiancé Drops Music Video With "No Love" Subliminals |website=hotnewhiphop.com |date=31 December 2018|access-date=6 March 2020}}</ref> 

In July 2019, Memphis released "Fall Back".<ref>{{Citation |title=Memphis Depay - Fall Back (Official Video) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sk6zkOc9SKY |access-date=2023-06-16 |language=en}}</ref> On 1 November 2019, [[Broederliefde]] released an album, ''Broeders'', which featured Memphis in the song "Lange Jas".<ref>{{Citation |title=Lange Jas |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RWyoj9WmVY0 |access-date=2023-06-16 |language=en}}</ref> On 17 April 2020, he released "Dubai Freestyle".

In September 2020, Memphis released his new song "2 Corinthians 5:7".<ref>{{Citation |title=Memphis Depay - 2 Corinthians 5:7 (Official Video) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjtNp-RStOs |access-date=2023-06-16 |language=en}}</ref> A month later on October 9th 2020, Memphis released "Blessing".<ref>{{Citation |title=Memphis Depay - Blessing (Official Video) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oss23JNZ3q4 |access-date=2023-06-18 |language=en}}</ref> The song's music video shows Memphis returning to his home town [[Moordrecht]]. Memphis wrote a passage in his autobiography "Heart of a Lion", which explained the meaning of the song.

“I wrote a track about this, called ''Blessings'', and it includes these lines:<blockquote>''Seems like everybody’s wishing for the same shit.''

''They want a [[Rolex|Roley]] and a chain, oh yeah''

''The other type of n*ggas that complain, ah''

''Keep waiting for a blessing but forget to pray, ah yeah''</blockquote>The point I’m making here is that young people wish for all sorts of things, but often forget to pray for them. Purely material success is often very empty. I know millionaires who are deeply unhappy, while the outside world thinks they’re successful and everything’s just perfect for them. I’ve learned that appearances can be deceptive. Being special in your own way: that’s true success."<ref>{{Cite book |last=Depay; Zwartkruis |first=Memphis; Simon |title=Heart of a Lion |year=2019 |location=Amsterdam |pages=130 |language=nl, en}}</ref>


On 27 November 2020, he released his debut album "''Heavy Stepper"''.<ref>{{Citation |title=Heavy Stepper |date=2020-11-27 |url=https://open.spotify.com/album/6GUlB3T4rAWUg0bDVRoFiO |access-date=2023-06-16 |language=en}}</ref> A 9 track EP including "2 Corinthians 5:7" and "Blessing" released as singles shortly before, and new tracks "Heavy Stepper", "Body Like You (feat.
