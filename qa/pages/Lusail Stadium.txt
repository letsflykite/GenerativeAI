== Design ==
Lusail stadium designed by the renowned British architects [[Foster + Partners]], incorporates cutting-edge technologies.The truly iconic design was inspired by the traditional fanar lantern; embellished by Arab bowls and vessels that reflect the heritage and culture of Qatar. The stadium is designed to be highly energy efficient and capable of performing in extreme summer climatic conditions.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Lusail Stadium |url=https://visitqatar.com/intl-en/things-to-do/adventures/other-sports-and-activities/lusail-stadium |access-date=2023-06-27 |website=visitqatar.com |language=en}}</ref>

The main axis of the master plan, which splits the stadium precinct into two parts, is where the stadium is located. It has a nearly circular footprint. Six bridges allow spectators to traverse the "moat" and enter the building, which is encircled by a reflected pool of water. The concrete seating basin appears to float above the saddle-form roof, which is subtly supported by a ring of arcing columns. The pitch can be completely covered or left open to the sky by retracting its central piece. The concave outer enclosure of the stadium features a system of movable louvers and is modeled like the sails of a typical dhow boat. The Lusail Stadium features a highly advanced environmental approach and is designed to be a catalyst for further expansion.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://manica.global/page/lusail-stadium-concept |access-date=2023-06-27 |website=manica.global}}</ref>
