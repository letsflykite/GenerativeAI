==Club career==
===Youth===
Andersen started playing football at the age of four for local club [[Greve Fodbold]], where he played from 2000 until 2009. He then joined [[F.C. Copenhagen Reserves and Youth Team|Copenhagen]]’s academy, School of Excellence, before leaving for [[FC Midtjylland|Midtjylland]]<ref>[http://sn.dk/Sydkysten/Grevedreng-klar-til-prof-karriere/artikel/348906 Grevedreng klar til prof-karriere]‚ sn.dk, 23 August 2013</ref> when he was 15.
At Midtjylland he moved into the talent academy in [[Ikast]]<ref name=colaer>{{cite web|url=https://www.tipsbladet.dk/nyhed/landshold/joachim-andersens-bumpede-succesvej-stjaalne-colaer-og-skideballe-hos-steinlein|title=Joachim Andersens bumpede succesvej: Stjålne colaer og skideballe hos Steinlein|website=Tipsbladet.dk|date=9 November 2018 }}</ref> where players like [[Simon Kjær]], [[Winston Reid]], [[Erik Sviatchenko]], [[Viktor Fischer]] and [[Pione Sisto]] had stayed before him.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

In April 2013, before he had made his first team debut with Midtjylland, [[FC Twente|Twente]] sent out scouts to observe Andersen, and offered him a one-week trial, which he accepted.<ref>[http://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/FCM-talent-Tempo-paa-i-Twente/ FCM-talent: Tempo på i Twente], bold.dk, 15 April 2013</ref> Four months later, he signed a youth contract with FC Twente for a fee rumored to be around 5 million Danish kroner (€650,000).<ref>[http://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/FCM-bekraefter-talentsalg/ FCM bekræfter talentsalg], bold.dk, 7 August 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/Avis-FCM-faar-fem-mio-kr-for-talent/ Avis: FCM får fem mio. kr. for talent]‚ bold.dk, 8 August 2013</ref> The plan was to start in the youth team in order to acclimatise, and progress to the senior sides after about 6 months.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

===Twente===
Though he was still an under-19 player he was promoted to the senior team and on 8 November 2013, Andersen made his first appearance for [[Jong FC Twente|Jong Twente]] playing the whole match.<ref>[https://int.soccerway.com/matches/2013/11/08/netherlands/eerste-divisie/jong-fc-twente/stormvogels-telstar-combinatie/1478798/ TWENTE II VS. TELSTAR 3 - 0]‚ soccerway.com, 8 November 2013</ref> He did not play any matches for the first team in his first season, but already in his second year at the club he was promoted to train with the first team squad with players like [[Dušan Tadić]], [[Hakim Ziyech]], [[Jesús Manuel Corona]], [[Quincy Promes]], [[Andreas Bjelland]], [[Kasper Kusk]] and [[Kamohelo Mokotjo]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

On 7 March 2015, he got his chance in the first team debuting against [[Willem II (football club)|Willem II]], and playing the last 20 minutes.<ref>[http://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/ung-twente-dansker-fik-debut-i-remis/ Ung Twente-dansker fik debut i remis], bold.dk, 7 March 2015.</ref> A week later, he signed a new contract with Twente until 2018.<ref>[http://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/twente-dansker-forlaenger-til-2018/ Twente-dansker forlænger til 2018], bold.dk, 16 March 2015</ref> In 2015, Andersen won the prize for U19 talent of the year by the [[Danish Football Association]].<ref>[http://www.bold.dk/fodbold/nyheder/talentpriser-til-yussuf-p-og-joachim-a/ Talentpriser til Yussuf P. og Joachim A.]‚ bold.dk, 17 March 2015</ref>

On 22 March, he was named in the starting eleven against [[FC Groningen|Groningen]] and scored his first goal for the first team. He slowly got more and more time on the pitch for the first team. He continued his development and became almost a regular part of the first team squad in the 2015–16 season.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

===Sampdoria===
On 26 August 2017, Andersen signed a contract with [[Serie A]] club [[U.C.
