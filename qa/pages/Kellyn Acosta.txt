==Early life==
Acosta was raised in [[Plano, Texas]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/history-making-asian-american-soccer-player-describes-journey-self-acc-rcna62119 | title=History-making Asian American soccer player describes his journey to self-acceptance | website=[[NBC News]] | access-date=December 17, 2022 | archive-date=February 18, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230218013632/https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/history-making-asian-american-soccer-player-describes-journey-self-acc-rcna62119 | url-status=live }}</ref> His father is Japanese American while his mother is African American.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/history-making-asian-american-soccer-player-describes-journey-self-acc-rcna62119 | title=History-making Asian American soccer player describes his journey to self-acceptance | website=[[NBC News]] | access-date=December 17, 2022 | archive-date=February 18, 2023 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230218013632/https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/history-making-asian-american-soccer-player-describes-journey-self-acc-rcna62119 | url-status=live }}</ref> Acosta's paternal grandmother is Japanese, and the surname Acosta comes from his Mexican paternal step-father.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/psg-ucl-collapse-kellyn-acosta-susannah-collins-jillian/id1513071118?i=1000553556640 |title=Fútbol with Grant Wahl Podcast |date=March 10, 2022 |access-date=March 25, 2022 |archive-date=March 25, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220325190902/https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/psg-ucl-collapse-kellyn-acosta-susannah-collins-jillian/id1513071118?i=1000553556640 |url-status=live }}</ref> Plano was an overwhelmingly white city when he was growing up. In his predominantly white neighborhood, Acosta said in 2022 he long tried to hide any evidence of his Japanese roots in order to blend in to avoid bullying or any confused stares at his multiethnic family.  “I wanted to fit in so bad there were times my Asian grandma would have to pick me up and park around the corner,” he told [[NBC News]]. “It was so puzzling for some and I kind of got made fun of for it.”<ref>{{Cite web |title=History-making Asian American soccer player describes his journey to self-acceptance |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/history-making-asian-american-soccer-player-describes-journey-self-acc-rcna62119 |access-date=2023-02-17 |website=NBC News |language=en |archive-date=February 18, 2023 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20230218013632/https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/history-making-asian-american-soccer-player-describes-journey-self-acc-rcna62119 |url-status=live }}</ref>
