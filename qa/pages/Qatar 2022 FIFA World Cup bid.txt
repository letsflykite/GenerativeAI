The '''Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid''' was a successful bid by [[Qatar]] to host the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]]. With a population of 2 million people, Qatar was the first [[Arab World|Arab state]] to host the World Cup.<ref>{{cite news

Qatar promoted their hosting of the tournament as representing the Arab World, and has drawn support from across the member states of the [[Arab League]]. They also positioned their bid as an opportunity to bridge the gap between the Arab World and the [[Western world|West]].<ref>{{cite news

In November 2010, Qatar hosted a friendly match between [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/sport/2010/2010/11/20101117195116291452.html |title= Argentina win Qatar's Latin clash  Announced |date= 17 November 2010 |access-date= 3 December 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/nov/17/international-friendly-brazil-argentina-live |title= Argentina 1-0 Brazil - as it happened |date= 17 November 2010 |access-date= 28 November 2022}}</ref>

Former president of FIFA [[Sepp Blatter]] endorsed the idea of having a World Cup in the Arab World, saying in April 2010: "The Arabic world deserves a World Cup. They have 22 countries and have not had any opportunity to organize the tournament". Blatter also praised Qatar's progress: "When I was first in Qatar there were 400,000 people here and now there are 1.6 million. In terms of infrastructure, when you are able to organise the [[2006 Asian Games|Asian Games (in 2006)]] with more than 30 events for men and women, then that is not in question".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/sport/2010/04/2010424184010305993.html|title=Blatter reaches out to Arabia|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=2010-04-25|access-date=2010-05-01}}</ref>  On the 2nd of December 2010, it was announced that Qatar will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9250585.stm |title= 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup Hosts Announced |date= 2 December 2010 |access-date= 2 December 2010 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

==Climate==
{{main|Geography of Qatar}}
Working against the Qatar bid was the extreme temperature in the [[desert]] country. The World Cup always takes place during the European off-season in June and July. During this period the average daytime high in most of Qatar exceeds 40&nbsp;°C (104&nbsp;°F), the average daily low temperatures not dropping below 30&nbsp;°C (86&nbsp;°F).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/QAXX0003?from=36hr_bottomnav_business |title=Monthly Averages for Doha, Qatar |work=weather.com |publisher=The Weather Channel |access-date=26 October 2009}}</ref>  In response to this issue, Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the 2022 Qatar bid chairman, has stated, "the event has to be organized in June or July. We will have to take the help of technology to counter the harsh weather. We have already set in motion the process. A stadium with controlled temperature is the answer to the problem. We have other plans up our sleeves as well".<ref>{{cite news

The first five proposed stadiums for the World Cup were unveiled at the beginning of March 2010. The stadium will employ cooling technology capable of reducing temperatures within the stadium by up to 20°[[Celsius|C]] (36[[Fahrenheit|°F]]), and the upper tiers of the stadium will be disassembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.recruitmentvartha.in/2015/01/fifa-world-cup-football-2022-stadium.html|title=Bidding Nation Qatar 2022 – Stadiums |publisher=www.recruitmentvartha.in |access-date=2010-05-30}}</ref> All of the five stadium projects launched have been designed by German architect [[Albert Speer, Jr.|Albert Speer & Partners]].<ref name="Qatar bid, FIFA">{{cite news|url=https://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/01/33/59/45/bidevaluationreport.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122113106/http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/01/33/59/45/bidevaluationreport.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 November 2010|title=2022 FIFA World Cup Bid Evaluation Report: Qatar|publisher=FIFA|date=2010-12-05}}</ref>

The Air Conditioning in the stadiums for both the players and spectators will be solar powered, carbon neutral and provided by [[Arup Group Limited|Arup]] of England.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/news/2010/12/101203_qatar_wt_sl.shtml|title=BBC World Service - News - Qatar 2022: How to build comfortable stadiums in a hot climate|work=bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

The Al-Khor Stadium is planned for Al-Khor city, located 50 kilometres north of Doha. The stadium will have a total capacity of 45,330, with 19,830 of the seats forming part of a temporary modular upper tier. The Al-Wakrah stadium, to be located in Al-Wakrah city in southern Qatar, will have a total capacity of 45,120 seats. The stadium will also contain a temporary upper tier of 25,500 seats. The stadium will be surrounded by large solar panels and will be decorated with Islamic art. The Al-Wakrah and Al-Khor stadiums would have been built regardless of whether Qatar was awarded the World Cup, according to the bid committee. However, the temporary upper-tier sections would not have been added if Qatar had lost the right to host the tournament. <ref name="Qatar bid, FIFA"/>

=== Bribery ===
{{main|Allegations of corruption and bribery related to the 2022 FIFA World Cup}}
{{See also|FIFA#2018 and 2022 World Cup bids}}
During May 2011, bribery on the part of two members of the [[FIFA]] Executive Committee were tabled by Lord Triesman of the English FA. These allegations were based on information from a whistleblower involved with the Qatari bid. [[FIFA]] has since opened an internal inquiry into the matter, and would consider a revote on the 2022 World Cup if the allegations were proven.  Former FIFA president [[Sepp Blatter]] conceded in 2011 that there was widespread support to re-hold the 2022 vote won by Qatar.<ref name="IndiaTimes">{{cite web|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-20/top-stories/29563906_1_fifa-world-cup-qatar-fifa-executive-committee|title=Qatar may be stripped off FIFA World Cup 2022: Sepp Blatter|date=20 May 2011|url-status = dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110909011521/http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-20/top-stories/29563906_1_fifa-world-cup-qatar-fifa-executive-committee|work=[[The Times of India]]|archive-date=9 September 2011}}</ref> 

In testimony to a UK parliamentary inquiry board in May 2011 [[David Triesman, Baron Triesman|Lord Triesman]] alleged that Trinidad and Tobago's [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]] demanded $4 million for an education center in his country and Paraguay's [[Nicolás Léoz]] asked for an honorary knighthood in exchange for their votes.  Also, two ''[[Sunday Times]]'' reporters testified that they had been told that Jacques Anouma of the Ivory Coast and [[Issa Hayatou]] of Cameroon were each paid $1.5 million to support Qatar's bid for the tournament.  All four have denied the allegations.<ref>''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', "Sorry Soccer", 23 May 2011, p. 16.</ref>  [[Mohammed bin Hammam]], who played a key role in securing the games for Qatar, withdrew as a candidate for president of FIFA in May 2011 after being accused of bribing 25 FIFA officials to vote for his candidacy.<ref>[[Associated Press]], "Bin Hammam leaves race after allegations", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 30 May 2011, p. 16.</ref> Both Bin Hammam and Warner were suspended by FIFA in wake of these allegations,<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13591142 | work=BBC News | title=Fifa suspends Bin Hammam and Jack Warner | date=2011-05-29}}</ref> with Warner reacting to his suspension by questioning Blatter's conduct and adding that FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke had also told him that Qatar had bought the 2022 World Cup.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fanhouse.co.uk/2011/05/30/fifa-soap-opera-latest-jack-warner-says-2022-world-cup-was-bou/|title=AOL Sport - Powered by Sporting Life|work=fanhouse.co.uk}}</ref> Valcke subsequently issued a statement denying he had suggested it was bribery, saying instead that the country had "used its financial muscle to lobby for support".

Qatar officials denied any impropriety and insist that the corruption allegations are being driven by envy and mistrust by those who do not want the World Cup staged in Qatar. [[Qatar Airways]] CEO [[Akbar Al Baker]] gave an interview to German media in June 2014 stating that "The country is not getting the respect it deserves over its efforts to hold the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] and that the [[Qatari Emir]] strictly punishes and forbids instances of corruption and bribery with a [[zero-tolerance policy]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/handel-dienstleister/qatar-airways-chef-al-baker-bedingungen-der-gewerkschaften-toeten-lufthansa/10125510.html |title=Terms of trade union are killing Lufthansa |publisher=Handelsblatt |date=30 June 2014 |access-date=4 July 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-fifa-qatar-idUSTRE74T4J420110530 | work=Reuters | title=Qataris brush off allegations of buying World Cup rights | date=2011-05-30}}</ref>

According to leaked documents seen by ''The Sunday Times'', Qatari state-owned television channel Al Jazeera (now beIN Sport) secretly offered $400 million to FIFA, for broadcasting rights, just 21 days before FIFA announced that Qatar will hold the 2022 World Cup. The contract also documented a secret TV deal between FIFA and Qatar's state run media broadcast Al Jazeera that $100 million will also be paid into a designated FIFA account only if Qatar wins the World Cup ballot in 2010. An additional $480 million was also offered by the State of Qatar government, three years after the initial offer, which brings the amount to $880 million offered by Qatar to host the 2022 world cup. The documents are now part of the bribery inquiry by Swiss Police.<ref name="JP">{{cite news|url=https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Qatar-offered-FIFA-880-million-for-hosting-the-2022-World-Cup-582998|title=Qatar Offered FIFA $880 Million for Hosting the 2022 World Cup – Report|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=10 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/revealed-qatars-secret-880m-world-cup-payments-to-fifa-p3r5rvw9x|title=Exclusive investigation: Qatar’s secret $880m World Cup payments to Fifa|work=The Sunday Times|date=10 March 2019}}</ref> FIFA refused to comment on the inquiry and responded to The Sunday Times in an email and wrote “allegations linked to the Fifa World Cup 2022 bid have already been extensively commented by Fifa, who in June 2017 published the Garcia report in full on Fifa.com.

=== Human rights and the conditions of migrant workers ===
The use of migrant labour in Qatar's construction of the tournament's numerous new stadiums has been a major source of debate around the 2022 FIFA World Cup. Amnesty International, a human rights organization, judged Qatar for its treatment of migrant workers and argued in a 56-page report that Qatar fell short to look into, address, and prevent the passing away of these workers.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Ingle |first=Sean |date=2021-11-16 |title=Amnesty report: Qatar migrant workers trapped and exploited before World Cup |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/nov/16/qatar-migrant-workers-trapped-exploited-before-world-cup-amnesty-report |access-date=2023-05-08 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=Qatar: "In the prime of their lives": Qatar's failure to investigate, remedy and prevent migrant workers' deaths |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde22/4614/2021/en/ |access-date=2023-05-08 |website=Amnesty International |language=en}}</ref> 

After all these years of Qatar being brought to light for its human rights records, what the public has been able to observe are the reforms the nation made to clear up its record and create room for structural improvement, as per a report by [[The Peninsula (newspaper)|The Peninsula Qatar]] that claimed the nation raised awareness through seminars, lectures, and training workshops in the local community. A specialized department for the promotion and defence of [[human rights]] was established, and it carried out its inspection and service duties for the general dissemination of the significance of human rights reforms. These actions were taken in May 2023 when the MoI ([[Minister of interior]]) hosted a seminar on "Services of the Human Rights Department to the Public" that also covered the services offered to the general public by the department, including the procedures used to carry out human rights.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Newspaper |first=The Peninsula |date=2023-05-01 |title=Ministry of Interior striving to enhance human rights in community |url=https://thepeninsulaqatar.com/article/01/05/2023/ministry-of-interior-striving-to-enhance-human-rights-in-community |access-date=2023-05-08 |website=thepeninsulaqatar.com |language=en}}</ref>

However the measures, which became enforceable on August 30, 2020, introduced a mandatory [[minimum wage]] of 1,000 Qatari riyal (roughly $275 USD) per month and made it easy for migrant workers to switch jobs before the end of their contracts without first requiring a [[No Objection Certificate]] (NOC) from their employer. Employers must give workers a living wage or provide allowances to cover these costs in addition to the raised minimum wage for everybody. All this was revealed in a report published by the [[Human Rights Watch|Human rights watch]].<ref>{{Cite web |title=UN human rights experts welcome Qatar’s improvement of migrant rights |url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2020/09/un-human-rights-experts-welcome-qatars-improvement-migrant-rights |access-date=2023-02-27 |website=OHCHR |language=en}}</ref> In their article, which was published in September 2020, experts from the OHCHR ([[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]]) added, "We are very encouraged by the bold steps Qatar is taking to increase the protection of [[Migrant worker|migrant workers' rights]] and ensure adequate living and working conditions for all."<ref>{{Cite web |title=UN human rights experts welcome Qatar’s improvement of migrant rights |url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2020/09/un-human-rights-experts-welcome-qatars-improvement-migrant-rights |access-date=2023-02-27 |website=OHCHR |language=en}}</ref>

The football associations of several countries qualified for the tournament have taken stands against these alleged [[Human Rights Violations|human rights violations]], and teams such as [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]] and [[Germany national football team|Germany]] have made symbolic protest actions to show their disapproval.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Netherlands join Germany & Norway in making Qatar human rights protest prior to World Cup qualifier {{!}} Goal.com |url=https://www.goal.com/en/news/netherlands-join-germany-norway-in-making-qatar-human-rights/cirepzsf5gd11pkqjhsdfh5d8 |access-date=2022-09-13 |website=www.goal.com}}</ref>

Furthermore, according to a statement by ITUC ([[International Trade Union Confederation]]) General Secretary [[Sharan Burrow]], who had previously been a harsh critic of Qatar's labour laws, workers can now obtain justice in the country. She praised "the amazing change of the labour legislation in Qatar."<ref>{{Cite web |title=Qatar's reforms ahead of FIFA World Cup showcased during International Labour Conference |url=https://www.fifa.com/social-impact/human-rights/news/origin1904-p.cxm.fifa.comqatars-reforms-ahead-of-fifa-world-cup-showcased-during-international-labour |access-date=2023-02-27 |website=www.fifa.com |language=en}}</ref>   

=== Extreme climate ===
{{See also|Climate of Qatar}}
The World Cup is usually held in the northern hemisphere summer. During this season in Qatar, the temperature can get to {{convert|50|°C|°F}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/485603/Qatar/256420/Climate | title=Encyclopædia Britannica Qatar Climate |publisher=britannica.com |date=2011-01-17 |access-date=2011-01-17}}</ref> Qatar says that this will not be a problem for it hosting the World Cup. A section from Qatar 2022 Bid official site explains:

:"Each of the five stadia will harness the power of the sun's rays to provide a cool environment for players and fans by converting solar energy into electricity that will then be used to cool both fans and players at the stadia. When games are not taking place, the solar installations at the stadia will export energy onto the power grid. During matches, the stadia will draw energy from the grid. This is the basis for the stadia's [[carbon neutrality]]. Along with the stadia, we plan to make the cooling technologies we’ve developed available to other countries in hot climates, so that they too can host major sporting events".

An example of this occurred during the 2018 World Cup qualifier with China under air conditioning, which happened on 8 October 2015.

Such cooling techniques will be able to reduce temperatures from {{convert|45|to|25|C|F|abbr=out}}, which would be comfortable for players and spectators during matches, the bid also proposes these cooling technologies to be used in fan-zones, training pitches and walkways between Metro stations and stadia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfootballinsider.com/Story.aspx?id=33206 |title=Qatar 2022 World Cup Bid Reveals New Stadium Plans and Cooling Technologies |publisher=Worldfootballinsider.com |date=2010-04-28 |access-date=2010-12-02}}</ref>
But if anyone enters an area without this technology, they may still be exposed to extreme levels of heat.

Qatar declared their intention to change the dates of the World Cup to winter immediately upon being award the Cup because of all the controversy surrounding the topic.

{{see|Alcohol in Islam}}
Alcohol can currently be consumed legally in hotel bars and clubs by showing a passport for reporting and a special permit to attend the club. The question of whether alcohol was allowed to be consumed in additional areas and at the games themselves was asked, Hassan Abdullah al Thawed, chief executive of the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid, said the Muslim state would also permit alcohol consumption during the World Cup. Qatar's bid promised that beer would be permitted at stadia, but this promise was reneged just days before the first game.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Panja |first=Tariq |date=2022-11-18 |title=Ban on Beer Is Latest Flash Point in World Cup Culture Clash |language=en-US |work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2022/11/18/sports/soccer/world-cup-beer-qatar.html |access-date=2023-01-20 |issn=0362-4331}}</ref> A few specific fan-zones were set up during the event, that would provide alcohol for sale.
