The second round of the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification tournament]] for the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] from UEFA (also known as the UEFA play-offs) was contested by twelve teams from the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|UEFA segment of qualifying]]. The play-offs determined the final three European teams that joined the group winners at the World Cup in Qatar. The ten runners-up from the UEFA first round groups participated in the play-offs, along with two group winners from the [[2020–21 UEFA Nations League]]. The teams were divided into three paths, each containing four teams, with each play-off path featuring two single-leg semi-finals, and one single-leg final. The matches took place in March and June 2022.

==Format==
The qualification format was confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in [[Nyon]], Switzerland on 4 December 2019.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/mediaservices/mediareleases/newsid=2634046.html |title=UEFA Executive Committee agenda for Nyon meeting |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=27 November 2019 |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref> The play-offs depended, in part, on results from the [[2020–21 UEFA Nations League]], although to a lesser degree than [[UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying play-offs|play-offs]] of the [[UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying]] tournament.<ref name="ExCo"/>

Unlike previous editions, the play-offs were not contested in two-legged ties. Instead, the twelve teams were split into three play-off paths, each containing four teams. Each play-off path was planned to feature two single-leg semi-finals on 24 March, and one single-leg final on 29 March 2022. The winners of the final in each play-off path qualified for the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] in Qatar.<ref name="ExCo"/> The semi-finals were hosted by the six best-ranked runners-up of the qualifying group stage, while the host of the final was determined by a draw.<ref name="play-off regulations">{{cite web |url=https://digitalhub.fifa.com/m/205b8634751aa743/original/teq6xtba5j54gogrcemo-pdf.pdf |title=Regulatory articles for the 2020–2022 European qualifiers play-offs |work=[[FIFA]] |format=PDF |date=22 October 2020 |access-date=22 October 2020}}</ref>

The play-offs were played in single-leg knockout matches. If scores were level at the end of normal time, 30 minutes of [[Overtime (sports)#Association football (soccer)|extra time]] would be played, where each team was allowed to make a sixth [[Substitute (association football)|substitution]]. If the scores remained tied, a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] would be used to determine the winner.<ref name="regulations">{{cite web |url=https://digitalhub.fifa.com/m/517ef2ad2bc3665e/original/ytkbpnxyvcghx6bebesv-pdf.pdf |title=Regulations FIFA World Cup 2022 Preliminary Competition: Including COVID-19 Regulations |publisher=[[FIFA|Fédération Internationale de Football Association]] |access-date=29 November 2021}}</ref> Following approval from the UEFA Executive Committee in December 2019, the use of the [[video assistant referee]] system was approved for the entire World Cup qualification tournament.<ref name="ExCo"/>

==Qualified teams==
Twelve teams advanced to the play-offs. Unlike previous editions, all participants were not decided solely on the results of the first round. Two of the twelve spots were allocated to group winners of the [[2020–21 UEFA Nations League|2020–21 edition]] of the [[UEFA Nations League]].<ref name="ExCo" />

===Second-placed teams (all ten advanced)===
The ten runners-up from the UEFA first round advanced to the play-offs. Based on the results from the qualifying group stage, the six best-ranked teams were seeded, while the bottom four were unseeded in the semi-final draw.<ref name="ExCo" /><ref name="play-off regulations" />

==Discipline==
A player was automatically suspended for the next match for the following offences:<ref name="regulations"/>
* Receiving a red card (red card suspensions could be extended for serious offences)
* Receiving two yellow cards in two different qualifying group stage matches (yellow card suspensions were carried forward to the play-off semi-finals, but not the play-off finals, World Cup final tournament or any other future international matches)

On 17 January 2022, following a UEFA request, FIFA announced the expiration of yellow cards received during the qualifying group stage, thus preventing suspensions in the play-off finals due to yellow cards received in the semi-finals. However, yellow card suspensions accumulated at the end of the qualifying group stage were still carried forward to the play-offs.<ref>{{cite news |location=Zürich |url=https://apnews.com/article/soccer-sports-europe-international-soccer-world-cup-bbe0963cfe20787fa0c1c08d49b24e91 |title=Yellow card amnesty agreed for World Cup playoffs in Europe |work=[[Associated Press]] |date=17 January 2022 |access-date=18 January 2022}}</ref>
