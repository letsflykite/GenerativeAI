'''Federico Santiago Valverde Dipetta''' ({{IPA-es|feðeˈɾiko βalˈβeɾðe}};{{refn|group=note|In isolation, ''Valverde'' is pronounced {{IPA-es|balˈβeɾðe|}}.}} born 22 July 1998) is a Uruguayan professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[central midfielder]] for [[La Liga]] club [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] and the [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay national team]].

In regards to his growing importance to the team, [[Santiago Solari]], his coach at Castilla, said on 29 January 2017, ''"I'm very happy with him. He has adapted very well to the club and country.

====Loan to Deportivo La Coruña====
On 22 June 2017, Valverde was loaned to [[La Liga]] side [[Deportivo de La Coruña]] for one year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rcdeportivo.es/noticia/fede-valverde-nuevo-jugador-del-deportivo-para-la-temporada-2017-2018|title=Fede Valverde, nuevo jugador del Deportivo para la Temporada 2017–2018|trans-title=Fede Valverde, new player of Deportivo for the 2017–2018 season|publisher=Deportivo La Coruña|language=es|date=22 June 2017|access-date=30 June 2017}}</ref> He made his debut in the competition on 10 September, replacing [[Federico Cartabia|Fede Cartabia]] in a 2–4 home loss against [[Real Sociedad]].
