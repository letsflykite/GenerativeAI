The '''Garcia Report''' was an investigation produced by U.S. lawyer [[Michael J. Garcia]] into allegations of corruption in world [[association football|football]].

In August 2012, Garcia declared his intention to investigate the bidding process and decision to respectively award the right to host the 2018 and 2022 [[FIFA World Cup]] to [[Russia]] and [[Qatar]] by the [[FIFA Executive Committee]].<ref>{{cite news |date=August 26, 2012 |title=FIFA to look into World Cup winning bids |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-08-27/fifa-to-look-into-world-cup-winning-bids/4224368 |agency=Australian Broadcasting Corporation }}</ref> Garcia delivered his subsequent 350-page report in September 2014, and Eckert then announced that it would not be made public for legal reasons.<ref name=GuardSep14>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/24/michael-garcia-fifa-investigation-public-world-cup|title=FIFA prosecutor Michael Garcia calls for World Cup report to be made public|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 24, 2014}}</ref>

On November 13, 2014, Eckert released a 42-page summary of his findings after reviewing Garcia's report.

==Appointment of Garcia and Eckert==
On 17 July 2012, in the wake of announced [[anti-corruption]] reforms by the [[List of presidents of FIFA|President of the FIFA]], [[Sepp Blatter]],<ref name=GuardJul12/> the organisation appointed former United States Attorney [[Michael J. Garcia]] as chairman of the investigative branch of its Ethics Committee, while German judge [[Hans-Joachim Eckert]] was appointed as Chairman of the Ethics Committee's [[adjudication]] chamber.<ref name=CNNJul12/> The reformed Ethics Committee was also given the power to retrospectively investigate old cases.<ref name=CNNJul12/> As Garcia and Eckert fulfilled FIFA's statute of them or their families not having a paid connection to soccer in the previous four years,<ref name=GuardJul12/> ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that "Garcia and Eckert are regarded as key independent figures from outside the so-called 'football family' who can help restore FIFA's credibility after bribery and vote-buying scandals."<ref name=GuardJul12/>

Upon their appointment, Garcia and Eckert were immediately tasked to investigate alleged illegal payments made by FIFA marketing company [[International Sports and Leisure]] (ISL) to former FIFA President [[João Havelange]] and former Executive Committee member [[Ricardo Teixeira]], as well as to evaluate the behaviour of FIFA President Sepp Blatter in the affair.<ref name=GuardJul12/><ref name=CNNJul12/> ISL had specialized in buying and selling broadcast rights to FIFA events such as World Cups on contracts worth millions of dollars.<ref name=IndyISL/> The case was closed on 30 April 2014 after an investigation by Garcia, with Eckert ruling that bribes had been paid by ISL between 1992 and 2000 to Havelange, Teixeira and [[Nicolas Leoz]], then-President of [[CONMEBOL]]. As Havelange (honorary President of FIFA) and Leoz had already resigned from their posts earlier in April 2014, no "superfluous" further action was taken.<ref name=IndyISL/><ref name=BBCISL/> In contrast, Blatter was exonerated of "criminal or ethical misconduct", but was also described as "clumsy" and it was questioned whether he "knew or should have known over the years before the bankruptcy of ISL that ISL had made bribes to other FIFA officials".<ref name=IndyISL>{{cite web|last1=Pitt-Brooke|first1=Jack|title=Joao Havelange guilty of taking bribes for World Cup rights but 'clumsy' FIFA president Sepp Blatter escapes|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/joao-havelange-guilty-of-taking-bribes-for-world-cup-rights-but-clumsy-fifa-president-sepp-blatter-escapes-8598250.html|work=[[The Independent]]|access-date=16 November 2014|date=May 2013}}</ref><ref name=BBCISL>{{cite news|last1=Bond|first1=David|title=FIFA's report into ISL scandal is just window dressing|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/22355455|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|access-date=16 November 2014|date=2013-04-30}}</ref>

In August 2012, Garcia declared his intention to investigate the bidding process and decision to award the right to host the 2018 and 2022 [[FIFA World Cup]] to [[Russia]] and [[Qatar]] respectively by the [[FIFA Executive Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|title=FIFA to look into World Cup winning bids|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-08-27/fifa-to-look-into-world-cup-winning-bids/4224368|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]|access-date=16 November 2014|date=2012-08-26}}</ref>

Garcia was assisted in his production of the report by [[Cornel Borbély]], the deputy chairman of the investigatory chamber of the FIFA ethics committee.<ref name=GuardOct14/> Borbély produced the section of the report that investigated Russia, as Garcia was sanctioned from entering the country, and the United States, to prevent a potential conflict of interest as Garcia is American.<ref name=GuardOct14/> Russia was the only bidding country which Garcia failed to travel to in the course of his investigations.<ref name=GuardOct14/>

==Blocked publication by Eckert==
Garcia delivered his 350-page report in September 2014, and it was subsequently announced by Hans-Joachim Eckert, the head of the adjudicatory arm of FIFA's ethics committee, that it would not be made public for legal reasons.<ref name=GuardSep14/> Eckert said that only his judgement on the report will be published, in the spring of 2015, and the report had only been seen by four people.<ref name=GuardSep14/> Eckert later announced that his overview of the Garcia report with Garcia's main findings, summary, conclusions and recommendations will be published by the middle of November 2014.<ref name=GuardOct14>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/17/fifa-report-cannot-published-legal-reasons|title=FIFA World Cup bidding report cannot be published for legal reasons – judge|author=Owen Gibson|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=17 October 2014|access-date=18 October 2014}}</ref> Eckert has said that "Many won't like what I am going to tell them" in reference to his forthcoming judgement on the report.<ref name=GuardOct14/>

==Summary released and Garcia resignation==
On 13 November 2014, Hans-Joachim Eckert released a 42-page summary of his findings after reviewing Michael Garcia's report; the summary cleared both Russia and Qatar of any wrongdoing during the bidding for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups,<ref name=WhatNow/> leaving Russia and Qatar free to stage their respective World Cups.<ref name=APfire>{{cite web|last1=Dunbar|first1=Graham|title=FIFA under fire after report on Qatar, Russia|url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/4de5fea12fc44b86bd7221bb429f360f/fifa-clears-russia-and-qatar-host-world-cup|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|access-date=14 November 2014|archive-date=16 November 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141116023958/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/4de5fea12fc44b86bd7221bb429f360f/fifa-clears-russia-and-qatar-host-world-cup|url-status=dead}}</ref> The summary noted that Russia provided "only a limited amount of documents available for review", as the computers leased to the Russian team had been destroyed, and several email accounts were unable to be accessed.<ref name=APfire/><ref name=BBCclears>{{cite news|title=World Cup inquiry clears Qatar but criticises English FA|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30031405|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|access-date=14 November 2014|date=2014-11-13}}</ref>

The Eckert summary was harsher on England and Australia, who had unsuccessful World Cup bids, finding "potentially problematic facts and circumstances" in their bids and stating that they had undermined the integrity of the bidding.<ref name=APrebuke>{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Rob|title=FIFA rebukes England, Australia World Cup bids|url=http://hosted2.ap.org/APDEFAULT/347875155d53465d95cec892aeb06419/Article_2014-11-13-SOC--FIFA-WCup%20Bids-England-Australia/id-76430f57e368489a967fdd48d95d5c3b|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|access-date=14 November 2014}}</ref> England was described as behaving improperly when trying to win the support of then-[[CONCACAF]] head [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]].<ref name=APrebuke/><ref name=BBCclears/> Australia was criticized for the links between its bid and its funding of football development in African countries, and that two Australia consultants "violated the bidding and ethics rules".<ref name=APrebuke/> The bid teams for Japan and South Korea were also criticized for distributing "gifts" and giving the appearance of "a conflict or an offer of benefits" respectively.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Harris|first1=Rob|title=FIFA Judge: England Damaged World Cup Bid Process|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/fifa-rebukes-england-australia-world-cup-bids-26880141|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|access-date=16 November 2014}}</ref>

The FIFA welcomed "the fact that a degree of closure has been reached", while the [[Associated Press]] wrote that the Eckert summary "was denounced by critics as a whitewash".<ref name=APfire/> Hours after the Eckert summary was released, Garcia himself criticized it for being "materially incomplete" with "erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions", while declaring his intention to appeal to the FIFA's Appeal Committee.<ref name=WhatNow/> There were several calls for the Garcia report to be released, including from FIFA Executive Committee members [[Jim Boyce]], [[Jeffrey Webb (football executive)|Jeffrey Webb]] and [[Sunil Gulati]], as well as FIFA presidential candidate [[Jerome Champagne]] and [[English Premier League]] chief executive [[Richard Scudamore]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Collett|first1=Mike|title='Pope' Blatter likely to ride out latest FIFA storm|url=http://ca.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idCAKCN0IY1V320141114?sp=true|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|access-date=15 November 2014|date=2014-11-14}}</ref><ref name=TelegraphCivil>{{cite news|last1=Rumsby|first1=Ben|title=FIFA embroiled in civil war over Qatar World Cup 2022 report|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/11231262/Fifa-embroiled-in-civil-war-over-Qatar-World-Cup-2022-report.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114161315/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/11231262/Fifa-embroiled-in-civil-war-over-Qatar-World-Cup-2022-report.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=2014-11-14|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|access-date=15 November 2014|date=2014-11-14}}</ref> Eckert, who was "surprised" by Garcia's response, refused to accede to calls to release the Garcia report, citing the "rights of confidentiality for continental law".<ref name=TelegraphCivil/> Less than a week later, Eckert was quoted as saying that the investigation was only at "an interim stage" and that Garcia "can now continue investigating towards the final report".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Grohmann|first1=Karolos|title=FIFA's Eckert plays down report differences with Garcia|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-fifa-eckert-idUKKCN0IZ0J520141115|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|access-date=16 November 2014|date=2014-11-15}}</ref>

On 15 November 2014, German Football League president [[Reinhard Rauball]] warned that [[UEFA]] may quit FIFA if Garcia's report is not published in full, citing that "If this doesn't happen and the crisis is not resolved in a credible manner, you have to entertain the question of whether you are still in good hands with FIFA".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gibson|first1=Owen|title=Germany warns Uefa may quit FIFA if World Cup report not published|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/nov/15/fifa-uefa-world-cup-germany-football|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=16 November 2014|date=2014-11-15}}</ref> On 18 November 2014, acting on the recommendation of Eckert, the FIFA lodged a criminal complaint with the Swiss judiciary relating to the "possible misconduct of individual persons in connection with the awarding of the hosting rights of the 2018 and 2022 World Cup", specifically regarding "international transfers of assets with connections to Switzerland".<ref>{{cite web|title=World Cup: FIFA launches criminal case over 2018 and 2022 bidding process|date=18 November 2014 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2014/11/18/sport/football/fifa-criminal-complaint-world-cup/index.html|publisher=[[CNN]]|access-date=18 December 2014}}</ref>

On 16 December 2014, the FIFA's Appeal Committee dismissed Garcia's appeal against the Eckert summary as "not admissible".

==Pending release of the redacted Garcia Report==
On 19 November 2014, following a presentation by [[Domenico Scala (manager)|Domenico Scala]], head of FIFA's audit and compliance committee and one of only six people to have seen the report at that time, FIFA's executive committee unanimously agreed to publish a "legally appropriate version" of the Garcia report, with parts redacted to preserve witness confidentiality. However, the Garcia Report will only be published after five ongoing ethics investigations started by Garcia into the following individuals are concluded; for [[Ángel María Villar]], [[Michel D'Hooghe]], [[Worawi Makudi]], [[Franz Beckenbauer]] and [[Harold Mayne-Nicholls]]. Meanwhile, the decision not to revisit the 2018 and 2022 vote was reaffirmed by the FIFA after Scala said that two independent legal experts he consulted supported that decision.<ref>{{cite news|title=FIFA World Cup report: Michael Garcia findings to be released|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30546139|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|access-date=20 December 2014|date=2014-12-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Homewood|first1=Brian|title=FIFA to publish Garcia report in 'appropriate form'|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-fifa-idUSKBN0JX1BV20141219|newspaper=[[Reuters]]|access-date=20 December 2014|date=2014-12-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=World Cup corruption report: What next for FIFA and Sepp Blatter?|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/0/football/30557451|newspaper=[[BBC Sport]]|access-date=20 December 2014|date=2014-12-19}}</ref>
