==Club career==
===Early career===
Mbappé began his career at AS Bondy, coached by his father, Wilfried. Another of his youth coaches at AS Bondy, Antonio Riccardi, stated,

{{blockquote|The first time I coached him was when he was six years old. You could tell he was different. Kylian could do much more than the other children. His dribbling was already fantastic and he was much faster than the others. He was the best player I've ever seen in 15 years coaching here. In Paris, there are many talents but I'd never seen a talent like him. He was what we call a 'crack' (the best).<ref>{{cite news |title=Les Bleus au berceau: "J'étais persuadé que Kylian Mbappé passerait à la télé!" |language=fr |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/football/psg/les-bleus-au-berceau-j-etais-persuade-que-kylian-mbappe-passerait-a-la-tele-03-01-2018-7480863.php |agency=Le Parisien |date=3 January 2018 |access-date=14 September 2018 |archive-date=14 September 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180914203725/http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/football/psg/les-bleus-au-berceau-j-etais-persuade-que-kylian-mbappe-passerait-a-la-tele-03-01-2018-7480863.php |url-status=live}}</ref>}}

Eventually, he moved to the [[INF Clairefontaine|Clairefontaine]] academy, putting on a host of impressive performances leading to numerous French clubs, and Real Madrid, [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]], attempting to sign him.<ref name="Youth">{{cite news |title=Kylian Mbappe: How France World Cup star rose to prominence |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44669497 |website=BBC Sport |date=1 July 2018 |access-date=1 July 2018 |archive-date=3 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180703152535/https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44669497 |url-status=live}}</ref> At the age of 11, Real Madrid invited Mbappé to train with their under-12s and visit the club's facilities.<ref>{{cite news |date=1 September 2017 |title=Kylian Mbappe joins Paris St-Germain: Why an 18-year-old is worth £166m |website=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/40904612|access-date=12 December 2020}}</ref> At age 14 he travelled to London after an invite from Chelsea, playing a match for their youth team against [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/arsene-wenger-likened-him-thierry-henry-but-who-arsenal-target-kylian-mbappe-a7565971.html |title=Arsene Wenger has likened him to Thierry Henry – but who is Arsenal target Kylian Mbappe? |date=6 February 2017 |newspaper=The Independent |access-date=31 May 2017 |archive-date=17 August 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170817084227/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/arsene-wenger-likened-him-thierry-henry-but-who-arsenal-target-kylian-mbappe-a7565971.html |url-status=live}}</ref> He ultimately settled on [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]].<ref name=youthcareer>{{cite news |url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/sg/features/kylian-mbappe-monaco-teen-who-might-be-europes-most-wanted-youngster |title=Kylian Mbappe: the Monaco teen who might be Europe's most wanted youngster |website=FourFourTwo |publisher=Future |date=3 September 2016 |access-date=23 November 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205153728/http://www.fourfourtwo.com/sg/features/kylian-mbappe-monaco-teen-who-might-be-europes-most-wanted-youngster |archive-date=5 February 2017}}</ref>

====2015–16: Development====
