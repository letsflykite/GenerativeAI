'''Rigobert Song Bahanag''' (born 1 July 1976) is a Cameroonian former professional [[association football|footballer]] who is the manager of the [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon national team]].

Known for his defensive skills, Song usually played as a [[centre-back]] but could also operate at [[right-back]]. Internationally, he played at a record eight [[Africa Cup of Nations]] tournaments and served as [[Captain (association football)|captain]] in five (the ones he was not captain for were [[1996 Africa Cup of Nations|South Africa 1996]], [[1998 Africa Cup of Nations|Burkina Faso 1998]] and [[2010 Africa Cup of Nations|Angola 2010]]), a record, and holds the record of most consecutive games played in the tournament with 35 first team games. He has won two CAF Africa Cup of Nations titles in 2000 and 2002. In 2009, Song was dropped as Cameroon skipper by new coach [[Paul Le Guen]], who eventually appointed [[Samuel Eto'o]] as the new captain but later caused concerns as Song had never been on the bench in more than 11 years for Cameroon.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cameroon hope to show claws |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/news/newsid=1215973/ |publisher=FIFA |date=22 May 2010 | access-date = 30 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> With 137 appearances, Song also holds the record of the most [[cap (football)|capped]] player in the history of the Cameroon national team and has played in four [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]], in [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]], [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Tottenham's Sébastien Bassong named in Cameroon's preliminary line-up |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/11/sebastien-bassong-cameroon-world-cup |work=The Guardian |date=11 May 2010 | access-date = 24 June 2010 |location=London}}</ref>

Song started his professional career with [[FC Metz|Metz]] and helped the club to win the [[Coupe de la Ligue]] in 1996. After appearing at the 1998 World Cup, he joined [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]], newly promoted to the top-flight Italian [[Serie A]]. In January 1999, he left Italy to start successive stints with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] and [[1. FC Köln]], but after failing to hold down a first-team place, he returned to France to play for [[RC Lens|Lens]]. He stayed there until 2004 and moved on to Turkey, where he spent four years with [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]], winning two [[Süper Lig]] titles and the [[Turkish Cup]]. Song then signed a contract with [[Trabzonspor]] in 2008, where he won another Turkish Cup and stayed until 2010.

Aside from [[Zinedine Zidane]], Song is the only player to have been sent off in two different World Cups, once against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in 1994 and against [[Chile national football team|Chile]] in 1998.<ref>{{cite news |title=Golden oldies and thrilling comebacks |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/world-cup/columns/story?id=788848&cc=5739&ver=global |publisher=ESPN |date=20 May 2010 | access-date =26 June 2010 | url-status =dead | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20100526030444/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/world-cup/columns/story?id=788848&cc=5739&ver=global | archive-date =26 May 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> He also holds the record as youngest player ever to be sent off in a World Cup, aged 17.

Rigobert Song Bahanag<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.fifa.com/fifaplus/en/member-associations/cameroon |title=Cameroonian Football Federation |publisher=FIFA |access-date=1 December 2022}}</ref> was born on 1 July 1976 in [[Nkenglikok]], Nyong-et-Kéllé.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://uk.soccerway.com/coaches/rigobert-song/4629/ |title=R. Song: Summary |website=Soccerway |publisher=Perform Group |access-date=1 December 2022}}</ref>

==Club career==
===Early years (1993–1998)===
Song started his professional career at [[FC Metz|Metz]]. He made several strong appearances that earned him a selection to ''The Indomitable Lions'' for the World Cup in 1994.

===Liverpool (1999–2000)===
Following his Italian experience with Serie A side Salernitana, Song transferred to [[Anfield]] with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] in January 1999 for £2.7 million.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ged's £128m spending – in full! |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/may/24/newsstory.sport4 |work=The Guardian |date=24 May 2004 | access-date = 30 June 2010 |location=London}}</ref> Having been frozen out by the Italians, the Cameroonian defender made a good impression during a trial spell at Anfield. Before he arrived, Song already had the distinction of playing in two World Cups for his country.

The first Cameroonian player to play for the ''Reds'', Song made his League debut against [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] at [[Highfield Road]]. Early on he earned the support of Liverpool fans, who appreciated his strength, all-action style and effort. His natural position was [[centre-back]] but during his time at Anfield, Song operated at [[right-back]] and became a figure for Liverpool's fans, who used to affectionately sing "We've only got one Song!" He had a mixed [[1999–2000 Liverpool F.C. season|1999–2000 campaign]], missing three months of the season due to international matches with the ''Indomitable Lions'', captaining them to victory in the [[2000 African Nations Cup]] and scoring the decisive penalty in the final game against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

Song was not able to find a spot in the starting eleven during the [[2000–01 Liverpool F.C. season|2000–01 season]] and played just four games. One of the games was a [[2000–01 UEFA Cup]] first round away game against [[FC Rapid București]].<ref name="UEFALiverpool">{{cite web |work=[[The Guardian]] |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2000/sep/14/uefa.sport3 |title=Rapid Bucharest 1 - 0 Liverpool |date=14 September 2020}}</ref> Liverpool eventually won the tournament, making Song an UEFA Cup winner. His last appearance for Liverpool was a 1–1 draw with [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] at Anfield on 23 September 2000. He made a total of 38 appearances for the ''Reds''. He left Anfield to sign for [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] on 28 November 2000 in a deal that also saw Liverpool capture young Finnish striker [[Daniel Sjölund]].

===West Ham, 1. FC Köln and Lens (2000–2004)===
Song signed for West Ham United for £2.5 million. The club identified the 24-year-old defender as a possible replacement for [[Rio Ferdinand]], who was transferred to [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Song completes Hammers move |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/1036838.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=28 November 2000 | access-date = 25 June 2010}}</ref> He made his West Ham debut on 29 November 2000 in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]. In a 4th-round game at The [[Boleyn Ground]], West Ham lost 1–2 to [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]]. Song's debut was described by the [[BBC]] as "unhappy".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=5&ham=4236&united=29_Nov_2000 |title=Game played on 29 Nov 2000 |publisher=www.westhamstats.info | access-date=9 October 2016}}</ref> In his first days, Song insisted that he did not want to be compared to Ferdinand, as he believed it was derogatory to his own talent.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Over two seasons he made 27 appearances for West Ham in all competitions without scoring, his final game coming on 29 September 2001; a 5–0 away defeat to [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] in the [[Premier League]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.westhamstats.info/westham.php?west=2&ham=754&united=Rigobert_Song |title=Rigobert Song |publisher=www.westhamstats.info | access-date=9 October 2016}}</ref> In November 2001 he joined [[1. FC Köln]] on loan, for the remainder of the 2001–02 season. He left West Ham on 26 June 2002, joining [[RC Lens]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.11v11.com/players/rigobert-song-285/ |title=Rigobert Song |publisher=www.11v11.com | access-date=9 October 2016}}</ref>

===Galatasaray (2004–2008)===
[[File:Rigobert Song.jpg|thumb|upright|Song with [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] in 2008]]

Song then signed for [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]] in 2004. He became an instant fan favourite after his transfer to Galatasaray and formed a strong defensive partnership with [[Stjepan Tomas]] at the heart of defence.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

During the [[2006–07 Süper Lig|2006–07 season]], he struggled to find a place in the team after an argument with then-Galatasaray manager [[Eric Gerets]] during a league game. Although Song apologized for the incident both publicly and privately, Gerets did not take a back step and the player remained punished. With the arrival of new coach [[Karl-Heinz Feldkamp]] in the [[2007–08 Süper Lig|2007–08 season]], Song once again become a vital member of the squad and the club's new captain. Upon his return from the African Cup of Nations with Cameroon, however, he found himself on the bench due to injury with the emergence of [[Emre Güngör]] who partnered [[Servet Çetin]] at the heart of the defence in Galatasaray's run for their 16th league title. With a better offer to play elsewhere, Song decided to leave at the end of the 2007–08 season to sign for fellow [[Süper Lig]] club [[Trabzonspor]].

===Trabzonspor (2008–2010)===
He joined the club on a free transfer. After a successful start to [[2008–09 Süper Lig|2008–09 season]], Song became fan-favorite in [[Trabzon]], playing 28 games in the league without accumulating any yellow or red cards, nor scoring any goals. After [[Ersun Yanal]] resigned as manager, however, Song lost his place in the starting lineup.<ref>{{cite web |title=Song eski günlerini arıyor |work=Mackolik.com |url=http://www.mackolik.com/Haber/82339/Song-Eski-Gunlerini-Ariyor |date=27 May 2009| access-date=10 September 2017 |language=tr}}</ref> Nonetheless, during the next season, he became Trabzonspor's new captain on 1 December 2009 after [[Şenol Güneş]] took over as the club's new manager.<ref>{{cite web |title=Trabzon'un yeni kaptanı Song |work=Ntvmsnbc.com |url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25027317/| archive-url=https://archive.today/20120904232506/http://www.ntvmsnbc.com/id/25027317/| url-status=dead| archive-date=4 September 2012 |date=4 December 2009| access-date=8 May 2010 |language=tr}}</ref> Trabzonspor became his last club of his professional career.

==International career==
[[File:20060816 191713 0072 Football Guinee-Cameroun.JPG|thumb|upright|Song playing for [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] in 2006]]

Considered a key player for [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] for over a decade, Song played in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994]], [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]], [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]] and [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s.<ref>{{cite news |title=New low for Italy, long-playing Song |url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/statistics/news/newsid=1257595/ |publisher=FIFA |date=24 June 2010 | access-date = 30 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2021|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> He made his international debut on 22 September 1993 in a game against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]].

At only 17 years old, Song was given a surprise call-up to [[Henri Michel]]'s Cameroon squad for the 1994 World Cup, playing two group matches in the finals against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] and [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]]. He received a [[Red card (sports)|red card]] in the match against Brazil, becoming the youngest player ever to be sent off in a World Cup, aged 17. Led by ageless striker [[Roger Milla]], the ''Indomitable Lions'' were knocked out in the group stage. The 24 years and 42 days age gap between Milla (42 years and 35 days) and 17-year-old future captain Song (17 years and 358 days) became (and remains) the largest between two teammates in World Cup history.<ref>{{cite news |title=Roger Milla: Indomitable Lionheart |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/world-cup/columns/story?id=743643&cc=5739&ver=global |publisher=ESPN |date=19 February 2010 | access-date =26 June 2010 | url-status =dead | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20100227131613/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/world-cup/columns/story?id=743643&cc=5739&ver=global | archive-date =27 February 2010 |df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Song then participated at the 1998 World Cup. Led by Song, [[Patrick Mboma]] and 17-year old young striker [[Samuel Eto'o]], Cameroon were eliminated in the group stage following a draw with [[Austria national football team|Austria]] (1–1), a loss to [[Italy national football team|Italy]] (3–0) and another draw with [[Chile national football team|Chile]]. After receiving a red card in the last game against ''La Roja'',<ref>[https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=1013/results/matches/match=8760/report.html] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203191633/http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition%3D1013/results/matches/match%3D8760/report.html|date=3 December 2013}}</ref> Song broke another record—he became the first player ever to be sent off at two different World Cups. [[Zinedine Zidane]], who was also sent off at this World Cup, has since achieved this feat as well, receiving his second red card in [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|the final of the 2006 tournament]].

Song was a part of the Cameroon squads that won the [[2000 African Cup of Nations|2000]] and [[2002 African Cup of Nations|2002 Africa Cup of Nations]]. After winning the 23rd edition of the football championship of Africa, The ''Indomitable Lions'' featured in the 2002 World Cup, but were again eliminated in the group stage following a 1–1 draw with the [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Republic of Ireland]], a 1–0 win over [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] and a 2–0 defeat to [[Germany national football team|Germany]].

Song's next tournament was the [[2003 FIFA Confederations Cup|2003 Confederations Cup]]. The ''Indomitable Lions'' qualified for the semi-finals after wins against Brazil (0–1) and [[Turkey national football team|Turkey]] (1–0) and a draw with the United States. The defender then led his team against [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] in the knockout stage. In the 72nd minute of the game, Song's long-time friend [[Marc-Vivien Foé]] collapsed in the centre circle, with no other players near him. Foé died the same day due to [[hypertrophic cardiomyopathy]], a hereditary condition known to increase the risk of sudden death during physical exercise. Cameroon eventually won the game 1–0, but lost to [[France national football team|France]] in the finals after extra time.

Although Cameroon did not manage to qualify for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] finals, the team participated in the [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]]. In the tournament, Song became the most [[Cap (sport)|capped]] player in Cameroon history. After three wins over [[Angola national football team|Angola]] (3–1), [[Togo national football team|Togo]] (2–0) and [[Congo DR national football team|Congo DR]] (2–0) in the group stage, the ''Indomitable Lions'' were eliminated in the quarter-finals by [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]], following a 24-shot shoot-out in which Cameroon was defeated 12–11.

Song was also part of the Cameroon squad for the [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations]]. After a 4–2 loss to [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] in the Group C opening match, the veteran defender led his team to wins against [[Zambia national football team|Zambia]] (5–1) and [[Sudan national football team|Sudan]] (3–0). In the first game against ''The Pharaohs'', Song's nephew [[Alex Song|Alex]] made his international debut for Cameroon, joining Rigobert on the pitch at half-time. The captain then carried the ''Indomitable Lions'' to the knockout stage, in which they defeated [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]] (2–3) and [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] (0–1) before losing the final to  Egypt 1–0. The only goal, made by [[Mohamed Aboutrika]], came after a mistake by Song, who covered his face with his shirt during the opponent's celebration.<ref>{{cite news |title=Final and third place |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/7236614.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=10 February 2008 | access-date = 22 June 2010 |first=Steve |last=Vickers}}</ref>

On 31 May 2008, Song scored the first goal for Cameroon after nine minutes in a 2–0 home win against [[Cape Verde national football team|Cape Verde]]. With the win, the ''Indomitable Lions'' took an early lead in Group 1 of the 2010 World Cup and Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers.<ref>{{cite news |title=Cameroon take Group 1 lead |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/7429401.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=31 May 2008 | access-date = 22 June 2010}}</ref>

In 2009, Song was dropped as captain of the Cameroonian national team, from the World Cup/African Nations Cup qualifiers by new coach [[Paul Le Guen]], but still remained the player that defined the image of the national team. Le Guen eventually appointed Samuel Eto'o as his new captain. On 12 August 2009, Cameroon's most-capped player was left out of the starting eleven for the first time in ten years in a friendly game against Austria.<ref>{{cite news |title=Song left out of Cameroon team |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/8198197.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=12 August 2009 | access-date = 22 June 2010}}</ref> In 16 years with the national team, he has been to the African Nations cup a record eight times, serving as captain in five competitions except in South Africa 1996, Burkina Faso in 1998 and Angola 2010).<ref>{{cite news |title=Cameroon omit defender Sébastien Bassong from squad |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/8427094.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=23 December 2009 | access-date = 22 June 2010}}</ref> Song holds the record of most consecutive games played in the African Nations Cup with 35 first-team games. He won the Nations Cup twice in Nigeria 2000 and Mali 2002, losing to Egypt in the finals in Ghana 2008.

In 2010, Cameroon was featured in the [[2010 Africa Cup of Nations]] but failed to win the tournament. On 13 January 2010, the ''Lions'' lost in a 1–0 group-stage upset against [[Gabon national football team|Gabon]] but won a match against Zambia four days later, 3–2. Despite being considered as an experienced player, some of Song's mistakes in the tournament were called "self-destructive": in the first game against Gabon, a defensive error by the veteran defender allowed [[Daniel Cousin]]'s goal, and against Zambia in the second, he headed a cross towards his own goal.<ref>{{cite news |title=Africa Cup of Nations: Cameroon 0–1 Gabon – as it happened |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jan/13/africa-cup-nations-cameroon-gabon-live |work=The Guardian |date=13 January 2010 | access-date = 24 June 2010 |location=London |first=Gregg |last=Roughley}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Ahmed Hassan and Rigobert Song set for legacy-defining battle |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2010/jan/25/ahmed-hassan-rigobert-song-egypt-cameroon |work=The Guardian |date=25 January 2010 | access-date = 24 June 2010 |location=London |first=Jonathan |last=Wilson}}</ref> The team still qualified for the quarter-finals with four points after a draw with Tunisia on 21 January, in which Song came in as a substitute.

===Personal life===
Song's father, Paul Song, died when he was young. As such, he never really knew his father but nevertheless dedicates all his success to him, as his absence was a strong motivational force for him. Song is married to Esther Song, and has four children (two sons and two daughters): Ronny, Bryan, Yohanna Bernadette and Hillary Veronique Liliane. They currently live in Liverpool. Rigobert is also a national ambassador for Cameroon.<ref>{{cite news |title=Biography of Rigobert Song |url=http://www.africansuccess.org/visuFiche.php?id=132&lang=en |publisher=African Success |date=16 June 2008 | access-date =23 June 2010 | archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20100613012610/http://africansuccess.org/visuFiche.php?id=132&lang=en | archive-date =13 June 2010 | url-status =dead}}</ref>

His nephew [[Alex Song]] has played as a defensive midfielder for clubs in France, England, Spain and Russia. About the relationship with Rigobert, Alex said, "I speak to him all the time and always call on him for advice. He's a good person to talk to because of his experience in England and I can ask him anything, depending on situations."<ref>{{cite news |title=Song sings uncle's praises |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/6389891.stm |work=BBC Sport |date=23 February 2007 | access-date = 22 June 2010}}</ref>
