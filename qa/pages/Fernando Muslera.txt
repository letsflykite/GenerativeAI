'''Néstor Fernando Muslera Micol''' ({{IPA-es|feɾˈnando musˈleɾa|lang}}; born 16 June 1986) is a Uruguayan professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for Turkish club [[Galatasaray S.K. (football)|Galatasaray]], whom he captains, and the [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay national team]].

He is considered one of the finest goalkeepers of his generation and was ranked as high as sixth-best in the world by the [[International Federation of Football History & Statistics]] in 2011.<ref name="fanatik.com.tr">{{cite web|url=http://fanatik.com.tr/Musleraya--buyuk-onur_3_Detail_32_249127.htm|title=Spor Haberlerinde Son Dakika Gelişmeler - Fanatik|last=fanatik|website=fanatik.com.tr|access-date=15 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219223108/http://www.fanatik.com.tr/Musleraya--buyuk-onur_3_Detail_32_249127.htm|archive-date=19 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Muslera began his career at [[Montevideo Wanderers F.C.|Montevideo Wanderers]] and [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]], moving to [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] in 2007 where he won the [[2009 Coppa Italia Final]]. In 2011, he was signed by Galatasaray for a fee of around €12 million, where he has since won honours which include six [[Süper Lig]] titles, four [[Turkish Cup]]s and five [[Turkish Super Cup]]s.

A full international since 2009, Muslera has earned over 130 caps for Uruguay. He has played in five [[Copa América]] tournaments, winning the title in [[2011 Copa América|2011]], and played every minute in goal for Uruguay as the country's undisputed number one in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]], [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]], and [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] [[FIFA World Cup]]s, helping his nation to fourth place in the 2010 edition.

==Club career==
===Uruguay===
Born in [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina, Muslera moved with his family to [[Montevideo]] where he began his professional football career with [[Montevideo Wanderers F.C.|Montevideo Wanderers]], having come through the club's youth system. After impressive performances for Wanderers, Uruguayan giants [[Club Nacional de Football|Nacional]] opted to take him on loan in 2007. After a display of successful performances, he began to attract attention from European clubs, and signed for [[S.S. Lazio|Lazio]] in 2007.{{citation needed|date=April 2023}}

===Lazio===
[[File:Fernando Muslera.jpg|thumb|left|Muslera playing for Lazio.]]

Lazio signed Muslera in August 2007 for a fee of approximately €3&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sslazio.it/images/stories/documenti/pdf/investor_relator/Bilancio_separato_e_consolidato_S.S._Lazio_S.p.A.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924105431/http://www.sslazio.it/images/stories/documenti/pdf/investor_relator/Bilancio_separato_e_consolidato_S.S._Lazio_S.p.A.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=24 September 2015 |title=Bilancio separato e consolidato S.S.Lazio SpA |date=23 October 2008 |access-date=22 May 2012 |publisher=SS Lazio |language=it }}</ref> He made his debut for Lazio in a 3–1 home win against [[Cagliari Calcio|Cagliari]] on 16 September 2007, and made four more consecutive starts, the last which was a disastrous performance in Lazio's 5–1 home loss to [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] on 7 October, a match in which he was at fault on four of the five goals Lazio conceded. That result saw him benched in favour of 44-year-old [[Marco Ballotta]]. He remained as the second-choice for the remainder of the season, making only four more [[Serie A]] appearances and none in the [[UEFA Champions League]]. However, he did play all of Lazio's remaining [[Coppa Italia]] matches, putting in good performances.

[[File:Muslera08072009.JPG|thumb|right|Muslera signing autographs at the new kits' presentation on 8 July 2009.]]

Muslera began the [[2008–09 S.S. Lazio season|2008–09 season]] as second-choice goalkeeper behind new signing [[Juan Pablo Carrizo]], but regained the starting spot in January 2009 following a run of poor form by Carrizo, coupled with conflicts with team management. Muslera's first starting appearance in the [[2008–09 Serie A|Serie A season]] saw him make several saves in a 3–1 loss to [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]], including saving an [[Antonio Cassano]] penalty. Further impressive performances in away wins over [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] and [[Genoa C.F.C.|Genoa]], as well as in his first ever ''[[Derby della Capitale]]'' against [[A.S. Roma|Roma]], saw Muslera regain a considerable amount of faith he had lost the previous season.

Known to the Lazio fans as "''Castorino''", or the "little beaver", Muslera was also an integral part of the club's successful [[2008–09 Coppa Italia]] campaign, making decisive saves against Milan and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] as Lazio reached the final for the first time in five seasons. In the [[2009 Coppa Italia Final|final]] on 13 May 2009, Muslera saved two [[Penalty kick (association football)|penalties]] as Lazio emerged victorious 6–5 in the shootout after the match ended 1–1 in extra time.<ref name="eurosport">[http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/13052009/3/muslera-hero-lazio-win-italian-cup-penalties.html Muslera the hero as Lazio win Italian Cup on penalties]&nbsp;– Yahoo! Eurosportgoooll, 5/13/09</ref>

The Uruguayan's impressive season saw him cement his position as the Roman club's first choice in the [[2009–10 S.S. Lazio season|2009–10 season]], despite the arrival of Argentine goalkeeper [[Albano Bizzarri]] on a free transfer. Muslera played in goal as Lazio opened the season with a 2–1 win over 2008–09 Serie A champions [[Inter Milan|Internazionale]] in the [[2009 Supercoppa Italiana]], played in [[Beijing]].

Following his successful performance in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] with Uruguay, Muslera was voted the seventh-best goalkeeper in the world by the [[International Federation of Football History & Statistics]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://spor.ekolay.net/haber.asp?PID=2623&HaberID=756562|title=Hürriyet - Haberler, Son Dakika Haberleri ve Güncel Haber|website=Hürriyet|access-date=15 October 2018}}</ref>
