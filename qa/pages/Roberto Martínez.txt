'''Roberto Martínez Montoliu''' (born 13 July 1973) is a Spanish [[Association football|football]] coach and former professional [[Football player|player]] who is currently the [[Manager (association football)|head coach]] of the [[Portugal national football team|Portugal national team]].

Martínez played as a [[defensive midfielder]] and began his career at [[Real Zaragoza]], with whom he won the [[Copa del Rey]]. He spent a year at lower league side [[CF Balaguer]], before signing for [[Football League Third Division|English Third Division]] side [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]]. Becoming part of a small Spanish contingent at the club known as "the three amigos" alongside [[Jesús Seba]] and [[Isidro Díaz (footballer, born 1972)|Isidro Díaz]], he was a regular [[first team (association football)|first team]] player for six years, the longest period of time he spent at one club. During his time there, he won the [[Football League Third Division]] and the [[Football League Trophy]]. He moved to Scottish side [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]], then to [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]], before joining [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] in 2003. He became club [[Captain (association football)|captain]] and helped the team to win promotion to [[Football League One|League One]] in 2005. He moved to [[Chester City F.C.|Chester City]] in 2006, and was again chosen to be captain.

He then joined Wigan Athletic as manager in 2009, helping the club avoid relegation for three consecutive seasons. In his fourth season Wigan were relegated, but won the [[FA Cup]] in 2013 for the first time in the club's history. At the end of that season he became manager of [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], finishing in fifth place in his first season at the club. In May 2016, he was sacked as their manager with the club in 12th position, and became Belgium's head coach on 3 August 2016. Martinez guided them to third place in [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], their best-ever position in the competition, as well as holding first place for Belgium in the [[FIFA World Rankings]] from 2018 to 2022. He resigned from Belgium after the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]]. In January 2023, he was appointed as the coach of [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Balaguer]], [[Province of Lleida|Lleida]], [[Catalonia]],<ref name=BDFutbol/> Martínez began his career at his home-town club [[CF Balaguer]] in the [[Tercera División]], playing his first competitive game for the club's youth team when he was nine years old. He played at every level of youth football for the club before moving to [[Real Zaragoza]] at the age of 16.<ref name="learning">{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/premier_league/wigan/article6879260.ece| title=Roberto Martinez's seat of learning| newspaper=The Times| location = London| date=18 October 2009| access-date=20 March 2011}}{{subscription}}</ref>

==Playing career==
Martínez made his first appearance for the [[Real Zaragoza B|Real Zaragoza B team]] in 1991, but spent most of his first three seasons at the club playing for the youth teams.<ref>{{harvnb|Martínez|2008|p=106}}</ref> On 20 June 1993, he made his debut for the [[Real Zaragoza|first team]] in [[La Liga]] on the final day of the [[1992–93 La Liga|1992–93 season]] in a 2–2 draw with [[Atlético Madrid]], coming onto the pitch as a substitute for [[Luis Cuartero]] in the 55th minute.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.lfp.es/Default.aspx?tabid=113&Controltype=part&t=092&j=38&el=3&d=1| title=Match Report Season 1992–93 – Matchday 38| publisher=LFP| access-date=5 April 2011}}</ref> During the following season, Martínez featured more regularly for the B team,<ref>{{harvnb|Martínez|2008|p=108}}</ref> helping the team regain promotion to the [[Segunda División B]] after being relegated in the previous season. In 1994, he returned to Balaguer to play for the first team, and also ran a football school for the club as an alternative to [[military service]].<ref>{{harvnb|Martínez|2008|p=113}}</ref>

Martínez was offered the chance to move to England by [[Dave Whelan]], Chairman of [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]], and he signed on a free transfer on 25 July 1995, joining fellow Spaniards [[Jesús Seba]] and [[Isidro Díaz (footballer, born 1972)|Isidro Díaz]], who were collectively referred to as the "''Three Amigos''".<ref name="bossmartinez">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/wigan_athletic/8096196.stm| title= Wigan finally land boss Martinez| publisher=BBC Sport| date=15 June 2009| access-date=27 September 2015}}</ref> He made his debut on 12 August 1995 against [[Gillingham F.C.|Gillingham]], scoring for Wigan in a 2–1 defeat. He finished the 1995–96 season as the club's top goalscorer with 13 goals in all competitions, and his impressive performances were recognised when he was named in the Division Three [[PFA Team of the Year]], and was also voted by the supporters as the club's Player of the Year.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10429~655342,00.html| title=Who Gets Your Vote?| publisher=Wigan Athletic F.C| date=20 April 2005| access-date=20 March 2011| url-status=dead| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120225084959/http://www.wiganlatics.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0%2C%2C10429~655342%2C00.html| archive-date=25 February 2012| df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Martínez won his first honours at the end of the following season, in 1996–97, when Wigan finished as [[Football League Division Three|Division Three Champions]]. He was once again named in the Division Three PFA Team of the Year, and was rewarded with a new four-year contract.<ref>{{harvnb|Martínez|2008|p=146–47}}</ref> Martínez was also at Wigan when the team won the [[Football League Trophy]] in 1999, for which he received a winners' medal despite being injured when the final was played.<ref name="flt99">{{cite web |url=http://www.cumbrialife.co.uk/aranalde-my-mate-martinez-deserved-it-1.316040?referrerPath=2.1878 |title=Aranalde – My mate Martinez deserved it |publisher=Cumbria Life |date=4 April 2006 |access-date=8 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322112753/http://www.cumbrialife.co.uk/aranalde-my-mate-martinez-deserved-it-1.316040?referrerPath=2.1878 |archive-date=22 March 2012}}</ref>

Released by Wigan on a free transfer at the end of the [[2000–01 in English football|2000–01 season]], Martínez signed a three-year deal with Scottish club [[Motherwell F.C.|Motherwell]] in July 2001.<ref name="motherwell">{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/1421073.stm | title=Martinez joins the Motherwell set| publisher=BBC Sport | date=3 July 2001 | access-date=6 April 2011}}</ref> He made only eight appearances, plus eight more as a substitute, before having his contract terminated at the end of the season after the club had entered administration a week earlier.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/motherwell/1958230.stm|title=Motherwell axe 19 players| publisher=BBC Sport| date=29 April 2002 | access-date=6 April 2011}}</ref>

He moved back to England to join [[Football League Division One|First Division]] club [[Walsall F.C.|Walsall]] on a free transfer in August 2002. Again, he did not feature regularly, starting just one game for Walsall (a home match against [[Reading F.C.|Reading]], in which he also got [[sent off]])<ref name="saddlers">{{cite news| url=http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/0200sport/globalsport/page.cfm?objectid=12569648&method=full&siteid=50002| title=Saddlers split with Martinez| publisher=icBirmingham| date=25 January 2003 | access-date=22 March 2011}}</ref> and making a further five appearances as a substitute. In January 2003, Martínez joined [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] on a short-term contract until the end of the season,<ref name="saddlers" /> becoming the [[Captain (association football)|captain]] and helping to preserve the club's [[English Football League|Football League]] status on the last day of the season. In June 2003, despite reported interest from First Division clubs, Martínez signed a new contract with Swansea.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/swansea_city/2986042.stm| title=Martinez chooses Swansea| publisher=BBC Sport

==Managerial career==
===Swansea City===
With Martínez in charge, Swansea lost just once in 11 games, giving them a chance of clinching a play-off place on the final day of the 2006–07 season, but missed out following a 6–3 defeat at home against [[Blackpool F.C.|Blackpool]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/swansea_city/7330805.stm| title=Martinez is the toast of Swansea| publisher=BBC Sport| date=13 April 2008 | access-date=9 May 2011}}</ref> Martínez won his first [[League Managers Association Awards|League One Manager of the Month Award]] for October 2007 by leading his team to four straight wins in four in the league, including a 5–0 win and a 4–1 win over [[Leyton Orient F.C.|Leyton Orient]] and [[AFC Bournemouth]], respectively, away from home.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11719_2841101,00.html|title=Martinez lands manager gong|publisher=Sky Sports|first=Andrew|last=Scurr|date=1 November 2007|access-date=30 January 2009}}</ref> He went on to win the Award consecutively, in December after a thrilling 3–2 win over [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] at the Swans' [[Liberty Stadium]], and in January after a second 4–0 win away from home against [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]]. He was also nominated for the February prize but lost out to [[John Ward (footballer, born 1951)|John Ward]], manager of [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]]. In April 2008, Martínez signed a new contract with Swansea as the club became [[Football League One|League One Champions]], securing promotion to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]], and in May 2008, he was awarded the [[League Managers Association Awards|League One Manager of the Year Award]] for leading Swansea to the title.<ref name="lg08">{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/swansea_city/7352739.stm| title=Martinez agrees 'improved' deal| publisher=BBC Sport| date=23 April 2008 | access-date=20 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/swansea_city/7397679.stm|title=Martinez crowned manager of year|publisher=BBC Sport|date=13 May 2008|access-date=30 January 2009}}</ref>

The 2008–09 season saw Martínez preside over Swansea's first game in [[English football league system#Structure|England's second-tier division]] in 24 years, which began poorly with a 2–0 defeat away at [[Charlton Athletic F.C.|Charlton Athletic]]. Subsequently, Swansea's form improved and they lost only four games out of the next 30, including a number of key league victories against opponents such as [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]]. Martínez also guided his team to a 2–0 [[FA Cup]] win against [[Premier League]] side [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]], who were the defending cup holders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/fa_cup/7842637.stm|title=Portsmouth 0–2 Swansea|publisher=BBC Sport|date=24 January 2009|access-date=30 January 2009}}</ref>

Throughout his time at Swansea, Martínez was often linked with other managerial jobs, but he often stated that he would only leave Swansea as manager if he was "forced out."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.scotsman.com/sport/respected-and-cultured-martinez-could-prove-a-real-coup-for-celtic-1-1040670| title=Respected and cultured, Martinez could prove a real coup for Celtic| newspaper=The Scotsman| location=Edinburgh| date=2 June 2009 | access-date=20 March 2011}}</ref> As his success grew, he publicly criticised players that left the club for money or for larger clubs. In June 2009, both [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] asked Swansea for permission to speak with Martínez regarding their managerial vacancies, with Wigan being granted the opportunity to hold talks with Martínez.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/swansea_city/8080510.stm|title=Martinez is Wigan's first choice|publisher=BBC Sport|date=3 June 2009|access-date=3 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/swansea_city/8076867.stm|title=Celtic want Swans boss Martinez|publisher=BBC Sport|date=1 June 2010|access-date=3 June 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite news

===Wigan Athletic===

Martínez's move to Wigan was not without controversy. Many Swansea fans were upset that he had chosen to leave the club despite his previous comments that he would have to be "forced out" to leave the club, and he was subsequently nicknamed "[[Judas Iscariot|El Judas]]" by some fans.<ref name="walesonline1">{{cite news | url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/footballnation/football-news/2009/06/18/roberto-martinez-is-the-fallen-hero-with-swansea-city-fans-91466-23907412/ | title=Roberto Martinez is the fallen hero with Swansea City fans | publisher=WalesOnline | access-date=27 April 2010}}</ref><ref name=eljudas>{{cite web | url=http://www.setanta.com/ie/Articles/2010/10/26/Wigan-v-Swansea/gnid-79856/ | title='El Judas' has the last laugh | publisher=Setanta Sports | date=26 October 2010 | access-date=15 December 2010 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612115911/http://www.setanta.com/ie/Articles/2010/10/26/Wigan-v-Swansea/gnid-79856/ | archive-date=12 June 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref> Martínez explained that his decision had been a difficult one to make, but felt the opportunity to manage in the [[Premier League]] at the club where he began his English footballing career was too good to turn down.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/s/swansea_city/8103690.stm | title=Martinez pleads for forgiveness | publisher=BBC Sport | date=16 June 2009 | access-date=15 December 2010}}</ref> His first league game as Wigan manager was an away fixture against [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]] on 15 August 2009.

In his first home game at the [[DW Stadium]], however, the team slumped to a 1–0 defeat to newly promoted [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolverhampton Wanderers]], and this was followed by a 5–0 defeat against [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]], despite being 0–0 at half time. This inconsistency set the tone for Martínez's first season in charge, with home wins against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] and [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], but also a series of heavy defeats. This included a 9–1 defeat away to [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham Hotspur]] on 22 November 2009, a club record defeat for Wigan, and the first time that a Premier League side had scored nine goals in a single match since Manchester United beat [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]] 9–0 in 1995.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_prem/8365091.stm|title=Tottenham 9 – 1 Wigan|access-date=23 November 2009|date=22 November 2009 |publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref>

On 26 October 2010, Martínez faced his former club Swansea in the [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]. Martínez received a hostile reception from Swansea fans as Wigan won the match 2–0.<ref name=eljudas /> On 10 June 2011, it was announced that Martínez had turned down an approach from Aston Villa regarding their vacant managerial position.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~2374417,00.html | title=Club statement: Roberto Martinez | publisher=Aston Villa F.C | date=10 June 2011 | access-date=10 June 2011 | url-status=dead | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612004440/http://www.avfc.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10265~2374417,00.html | archive-date=12 June 2011 | df=dmy-all }}</ref>

After a good start to the [[2011–12 Premier League|2011–12]] campaign, Wigan suffered eight straight defeats to leave them at the bottom of the league.<ref name=MOTM0412/> Between August and February, Wigan won a mere four games, leading to predictions that relegation to the [[Football League Championship|Championship]] would be inevitable for Wigan.<ref name=MOTM0412>{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/9/england/2012/05/04/3080679/roberto-martinez-wins-barclays-manager-of-the-month-for|title=Roberto Martinez made Manager of the Month|access-date=25 May 2012 |date=4 May 2012|publisher=Goal.com}}</ref> As the end of the season approached, however, Wigan's form improved dramatically as they recorded wins against Liverpool, Arsenal, Manchester United, and [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]], among others. This remarkable late rally, which involved seven wins in nine games, led to Wigan finishing 15th in the league – seven points clear of relegation – and also saw Martínez awarded his first [[Premier League Manager of the Month|Premier League Manager of the Month Award]] for April 2012.<ref name=MOTM0412/>

On 17 May 2012, Wigan chairman Dave Whelan confirmed that [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]] had been given permission to discuss their managerial vacancy with Martínez. However the job eventually went to [[Swansea City F.C.|Swansea]] manager [[Brendan Rodgers]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/18110974|title=Brendan Rodgers 'no' to Liverpool talks but Roberto Martinez in frame|access-date=25 May 2012 |date=18 May 2012|publisher=BBC Sport}}</ref> Martínez said that he wished to remain at Wigan in order to create "a legacy" at the club.<ref>

On 26 September 2012, Martínez was charged by the [[The Football Association|FA]] for comments made after Wigan's 4–0 loss to Manchester United on 15 September 2012. He accused match officials of favouring United at [[Old Trafford]] and said that [[Danny Welbeck]] should have been sent off.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/19729114 |title=Roberto Martinez charged by FA for comments after Man Utd defeat|publisher=BBC Sport |date=26 September 2012 |access-date=26 September 2012}}</ref>
