==Background==
Since the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)|1998 FIFA World Cup qualification]] the last round of the Asian qualifiers (in this case, the fourth round) has consisted of a matchup between two teams coming from a previous round, and the winning team would represent [[Asian Football Confederation|AFC]] in the intercontinental play-offs (except the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)#Play-off|1998 campaign]], in which the play-off winners qualified directly for the FIFA World Cup, while the losers advanced to the [[1998 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC–OFC play-off)|intercontinental play-offs]]).

The United Arab Emirates had previously played once at this stage, they faced [[Iran national football team|Iran]] in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC)#Play-off|2002 play-off]] and lost 0–4 on aggregate. Australia had also previously played at this stage once, it was the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC fourth round|2018 edition]] where they defeated [[Syria national football team|Syria]] 3–2 on aggregate.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.the-afc.com/en/national/asian_qualifiers/news/afc_asian_qualifiers_4_classic_playoffs.html |title=Asian Playoffs: 4 Classic Encounters |publisher=[[Asian Football Confederation]] |date=2 June 2022}}</ref>

This was the third match between the United Arab Emirates and Australia in the Asian World Cup qualifying, with the previous two being Australian victories (both in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC third round#Group B|2018 qualifiers]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.the-afc.com/en/national/asian_qualifiers/news/preview_-_asian_playoff_united_arab_emirates_v_australia.html |title=Preview - Asian Playoff: United Arab Emirates v Australia |publisher=Asian Football Confederation |date=6 June 2022}}</ref>

==Format==
In the fourth round, the two third-placed teams from the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – AFC third round|third round]] competed in a single-match play-off. Since the fourth round format was changed from two-legged tie to a single-match at a neutral venue, the game was played under the single-leg play-off rules from the preliminary competition, with [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]] of two periods of 15 minutes would be played if the match was tied after the regular time of 90 minutes, followed by a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] to decide the winner if the match still tied after extra time (Regulations Article 20.11).<ref name="regulations">{{cite web|url=https://digitalhub.fifa.com/m/517ef2ad2bc3665e/original/ytkbpnxyvcghx6bebesv-pdf.pdf|title=REGULATIONS FIFA World Cup 2022 Preliminary Competition Including COVID-19 Regulations|publisher=[[FIFA]]|date=29 September 2020}}</ref>

The winner advanced to the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification (inter-confederation play-offs)|intercontinental play-offs]] six days later, also in Qatar.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://en.as.com/en/2021/11/26/soccer/1637955253_226019.html |title=2022 World Cup inter-confederation play-off draw: fixtures and format |last=Allen |first=William |work=as.com |date=26 November 2021 |access-date=30 November 2021}}</ref>
