Vitinha is a highly creative and technically gifted [[playmaker]], with excellent [[Dribbling#Association football|dribbling]] skills and ball control, which allows him to operate effectively in a [[Midfielder#Deep-lying playmaker (Strolling 10)|deep-seated playmaking]] role as a [[central midfielder]], although he is also capable of playing in a more advanced role as an [[attacking midfielder]]. He is a [[central midfielder]] who enjoys taking the ball off the toe of his centre-back before distributing to a teammate near or far, but always with forward momentum in mind. His skill and quick control make it almost impossible for the opposition press to work when he is in possession.<ref>{{Cite web|date=5 July 2022|title=Vitinha, PSG's new midfield magician|url=https://www.ligue1.com/Articles/ONE-TO-WATCH/2022/07/05/one-to-watch-vitinha-psg-s-new-midfield-magician|access-date=25 October 2022|website=www.ligue1.com}}</ref> He is really good at progressing the ball and has the ability to get the ball into dangerous locations with his passes and is extremely quick with his feet and is good at evading players. He excels in counter-pressing, recovering and tackling. He is very quick-witted when it comes to creating counter-attacks right after winning the ball. Off the ball, he tries to prevent the opposition's attacks, and when he is on the ball, he helps his side in retaining the ball as he has excellent on-the-ball composure. He is also very good at reading the game and intercepting the ball, when it comes to winning the ball back he knows when to strategically foul the opponent in order to slow down an attack.<ref>{{Cite web|date=8 April 2022|title=Vitinha - A Star in the Making|url=https://medium.com/@pranav_m28/vitinha-one-for-the-future-eedc46a61933|access-date=25 October 2022|website=medium.com}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Vitinha's father is [[Vítor Manuel]], a former professional footballer who played as a midfielder for several clubs including his hometown's [[Clube Desportivo das Aves|Desportivo das Aves]] for several years and Faro's [[Farense]] from 1999 to 2001.<ref>Vítor Manuel, zerozero.pt https://www.zerozero.pt/player.php?id=9042</ref>
