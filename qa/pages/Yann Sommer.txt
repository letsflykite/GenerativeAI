'''Yann Sommer''' (born 17 December 1988) is a Swiss professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Bundesliga]] club [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]] and the [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland national team]].

Sommer completed his apprenticeship at [[FC Basel|Basel]], where he won the [[Swiss Super League]] on four consecutive occasions before transferring to Mönchengladbach in 2014. He also won the [[Swiss Challenge League]] and two [[Liechtenstein Football Cup]]s while on loan to [[FC Vaduz|Vaduz]].

Sommer made his debut for the [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland national team]] in 2012. He represented the nation at the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]], [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022]], and the [[UEFA European Championship]] in [[UEFA Euro 2016|2016]] and [[UEFA Euro 2020|2020]].

==Club career==
===Basel===
Born in [[Morges]], [[Vaud]], Sommer played as a child in the youth teams of FC [[Herrliberg]] and later of [[FC Concordia Basel|Concordia Basel]]. He moved to the [[FC Basel|Basel]] youth setup in 2003. He signed his first professional contract with Basel in 2005. He became the first-choice goalkeeper in the under-21 squad almost immediately, fending off opposition like [[Jayson Leutwiler]] and [[Orkan Avci]], and was third-choice for the senior squad behind [[Franco Costanzo]] and [[Louis Crayton]].

During the summer of 2007, Sommer signed a new contract lasting until 2011, and was loaned out to Liechtensteiner club [[FC Vaduz|Vaduz]] to gain first-team experience in an environment somewhat more competitive than the reserves in the [[1. Liga Classic|Swiss 1. Liga]]. He was made the first-choice goalkeeper and played 33 matches over the course of the [[2007–08 Swiss Challenge League]] season, playing a major part in Vaduz's promotion to the [[Swiss Super League]]. His loan deal was then extended to last until January 2009. He made his Super League debut for Vaduz on 20 July 2008 in the 2–1 away win against [[FC Luzern|Luzern]]. Sommer was recalled to Basel on 7 January 2009 because the club's first-choice goalkeeper, Franco Costanzo, was injured.<ref name=" Sport.ch ">{{cite web | last = Mastroberardino | first = Svenja | date = 5 February 2009 | url = http://sport.ch.sportalsports.com//sportch/generated/article/fussball/2009/02/05/7083100000.html | title = Costanzo: "Sommer ist einer der besten Goalies" | publisher = sport.ch | access-date = 21 December 2014 | language = de | archive-date = 24 March 2012 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120324200631/http://sport.ch.sportalsports.com//sportch/generated/article/fussball/2009/02/05/7083100000.html | url-status = live }}</ref>

Sommer made his Super League debut for Basel in a 3–2 defeat to [[BSC Young Boys|Young Boys]] at the [[Stade de Suisse, Wankdorf]], on 7 February 2009. He played six matches for Basel up until the end of the season. On 16 June, he joined [[Grasshopper Club Zürich|Grasshoppers]] on a one-season-long loan.<ref name=" FC Basel 1893 1 ">{{cite web|date=16 June 2009 |url=http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID//10044/22370/16/7 |title=Sommer leihweise zu GC – Colomba zum FCB |publisher=FC Basel 1893 |access-date=16 June 2009 |language=de |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090622190140/http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID/10044/22370/16/7 |archive-date=22 June 2009 }}</ref> During his season there, he played 33 league matches.

On 14 June 2010, Sommer signed a five-year contract with Basel.<ref name=" FC Basel 1893 2 ">{{cite web|date=14 June 2010 |url=http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID/-/10044/24338 |title=Yann Sommer mit Fünfjahres-Vertrag zurück zum FCB |publisher=FC Basel 1893 |access-date=14 June 2010 |language=de |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120405060935/http://www.fcb.ch/news/show/byItemID/-/10044/24338 |archive-date=5 April 2012 }}</ref> He served as second-choice goalkeeper behind Franco Costanzo. In March 2011, Basel announced it would not offer Costanzo a contract extension, therefore making Sommer the club's first-choice goalkeeper. Sommer played five Super League matches during the [[2010–11 Swiss Super League|2010–11 season]] and so was part of the championship-winning team.
