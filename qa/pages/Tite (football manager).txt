'''Adenor Leonardo Bacchi''' (born 25 May 1961), commonly known as '''Tite''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈtʃitʃ(i)|br}}),<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/features/7-things-you-should-know-about-incoming-brazil-boss-tite-and-whats-his-plate|title=7 things you should know about incoming Brazil boss Tite – and what's on his plate|date=17 June 2016|work=FourFourTwo}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://forvo.com/search/Tite/pt/|title=Pronunciations for Tite in Portuguese}}</ref> is a Brazilian professional [[Association football|football]] coach and former player who was the head coach of the [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national team]] from 2016 to 2022.

Tite played from 1978 to 1984 for [[Sociedade Esportiva e Recreativa Caxias do Sul|Caxias]], then a season for [[Clube Esportivo de Bento Gonçalves|Esportivo de Bento Gonçalves]] and a season for [[Associação Portuguesa de Desportos|Portuguesa]]. The three following seasons from 1986 to 1989 at [[Guarani Futebol Clube|Guarani]] were his most successful as player. At age 27, he ended his career due to successive knee injuries that caused him to lose mobility in one of his knees.

From 1991 onwards, Tite coached more than 10 teams in more than 15 stints. Amongst these were his first club, [[Sociedade Esportiva e Recreativa Caxias do Sul|Caxias]] that he returned to in 1999, and they won the 2000 [[Campeonato Gaúcho]] defeating [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]], which had [[Ronaldinho]] in its team. Due to the achievements with Caxias, Tite became the Grêmio coach in 2001 where they won the 2001 [[Campeonato Gaúcho]] and the [[2001 Copa do Brasil]]. He stayed until 2003 when Tite trained other teams: [[Associação Desportiva São Caetano|São Caetano]], [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]] in 2004, [[Clube Atlético Mineiro|Atlético Mineiro]] in 2005, [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]] in 2006, and [[Al Ain FC|Al Ain]] of the [[United Arab Emirates]] in 2007. From 2008 to 2009 he trained [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]] and they won the [[2008 Copa Sudamericana]] and the [[2009 Campeonato Gaúcho]]. At the end of 2010 he was announced as a coach of [[Al Wahda S.C.C.|Al Wahda]] of the United Arab Emirates, but he left the club months later to return to Corinthians.{{CN|date=December 2022}}

For Corinthians, Tite won the [[2011 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A]] title, the [[2012 Copa Libertadores]] title, the [[2012 FIFA Club World Cup]] title against [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], the [[2013 Campeonato Paulista]] and the [[2013 Recopa Sudamericana]]. On 14 November 2013, Tite announced that he was leaving the club. After a sabbatical period, Tite returned to Corinthians in 2015, where they won the [[2015 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A]].

==Club career==
Tite began his playing career in 1978 for [[Sociedade Esportiva e Recreativa Caxias do Sul|Caxias]]. In 1984 he played for [[Clube Esportivo de Bento Gonçalves|Esportivo de Bento Gonçalves]]. In 1985 he played for [[Associação Portuguesa de Desportos|Portuguesa]]. From 1986 until 1988 he played for [[Guarani Futebol Clube|Guarani]], in which he achieved the greatest honors as a player in his career, being part of the squad that finished as runners-up in the [[1986 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A]], the 1987 [[Copa União]] and the 1988 [[Campeonato Paulista|São Paulo State Championship]]. His career, however, was ended prematurely at age 27 due to successive knee injuries, which caused him to lose mobility in one of the knees.<ref>{{cite web |author=Por&nbsp;Carlos Augusto FerrariSão Paulo |url=http://www.velozindosports.com/products/pai%20coruja%20e%20marido%20dedicado,%20tite%20apresenta%20familia%20e%20vida%20fora%20do%20tim%C3%A3o/ |title=Pai coruja e marido dedicado, Tite apresenta família e vida fora do Timão :: Marketing esportivo |publisher=Velozindosports.com |access-date=22 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130205221559/http://www.velozindosports.com/products/pai%20coruja%20e%20marido%20dedicado,%20tite%20apresenta%20familia%20e%20vida%20fora%20do%20tim%C3%A3o/ |archive-date=5 February 2013 }}</ref>

After leaving Guarani, Tite opened a sports shop in [[Bento Gonçalves, Rio Grande do Sul|Bento Gonçalves]], but was invited to play for {{ill|Grêmio Atlético Guarany|lt=Guarany de Garibaldi|pt}} in the 1990 [[Campeonato Gaúcho Série A2|Campeonato Gaúcho Segunda Divisão]]; knowing his physical limitations, he accepted the offer but also became the club's fitness coach, to help them reduce costs.<ref name=GZH>{{cite web|url=https://gauchazh.clicrbs.com.br/esportes/noticia/2016/06/como-tite-assumiu-seu-primeiro-trabalho-como-tecnico-6005080.html|title=Quem é Tite: como assumiu seu primeiro trabalho como técnico|trans-title=Who is Tite: how did he took over his first job as manager|publisher=Gaúcha ZH|language=pt-BR|date=16 June 2016|accessdate=22 December 2021}}</ref>

==Coaching career==
===Early career===
Midway through the 1990 ''Segundona'', Guarany's manager Celso Freitas left the club, and Tite was appointed manager on his place.<ref name=GZH/> In 1991, after narrowly missing out promotion with Guarany, he was named in charge of [[Sociedade Esportiva e Recreativa Caxias do Sul|Caxias]],<ref name=GZH/> but left the club in 1992.

Tite joined [[Veranópolis Esporte Clube Recreativo e Cultural|Veranópolis]] in 1992,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uol/copadomundo/especiais/a-primeira-estrela.htm#a-segundona-hoje-ja-e-dificil-tu-imagina-em-1992-1993|title="A Segundona hoje já é difícil.

Tite was in charge of [[Esporte Clube Juventude|Juventude]] for a brief period during the 1997 season, but was sacked during the year's [[Campeonato Gaúcho]] and replaced by [[Gílson Nunes]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/fol/esp/s2029825.htm|title=Juventude tenta superar má campanha do estadual|trans-title=Juventude try to overcome poor campaign in the state league|publisher=[[Folha de S.

===Early success===
====Caxias====
In 1999, Tite was hired by [[SER Caxias|Caxias]], his first club as a professional footballer, leading the team through a surprising campaign in the 2000 [[Campeonato Gaúcho]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.futebolao.com.br/historico/gaucho2000.htm |title=Campeonato Gaúcho |publisher=Futebolao.com.br |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605233713/http://www.futebolao.com.br/historico/gaucho2000.htm |archive-date=5 June 2013 }}</ref> Caxias were the champions of the Rio Grande do Sul state tournament, defeating [[Ronaldinho]]'s [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]], winning the first match at the finals by 3–0 and drawing the second one with no goals. Tite's success on the ''Gauchão'' drew the attention of the Rio Grande do Sul press, as the Campeonato Gaúcho is rarely claimed by any team other than the "big two", Grêmio and [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.clicrbs.com.br/blog/jsp/default.jsp?source=DYNAMIC,blog.BlogDataServer,getBlog&uf=1&local=1&template=3948.dwt&section=Blogs&post=78615&blog=158&coldir=1&topo=4029.dwt |title=Gauchão 2000: a glória eterna do Caxias (Perin, saudando a torcida grená!) &#124; Almanaque Esportivo |publisher=Clicrbs.com.br |date=22 June 2000}}</ref>

====Grêmio====
Signed by Grêmio in 2001, Tite led the [[Porto Alegre]] squad to another ''Gauchão'' title, defeating [[Esporte Clube Juventude|Juventude]] in the finals, winning by 3–2 and 3–1 and claiming the 2001 Campeonato Gaúcho for Grêmio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.futebolnarede.com/campeonato/gaucho/gauchao-tabela-2001.php |title=Tabela do Campeonato Gaúcho 2001 |publisher=Futebolnarede.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120122074001/http://www.futebolnarede.com/campeonato/gaucho/gauchao-tabela-2001.php |archive-date=22 January 2012 }}</ref>

In the same year, Grêmio won the [[2001 Copa do Brasil]] under Tite's command, knocking out a respectable selection of teams throughout the brackets, such as [[Villa Nova Atlético Clube|Villa Nova]] on the first stage, [[Santa Cruz Futebol Clube|Santa Cruz]] on the second, [[Fluminense FC|Fluminense]] on the round of 16, [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]] on the quarter-finals, and [[Coritiba FC|Coritiba]] on the semifinals. Facing [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]] on the finals, Tite's Grêmio drew the first leg of the finals at their home stadium, [[Estádio Olímpico Monumental]], by 2–2. In front of a capacity crowd at [[Estádio do Morumbi]], Grêmio defeated [[Marcelinho Carioca]] and [[Müller (footballer, born 1966)|Müller]]'s Corinthians 3–1, claiming what would be Tite's first national title.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gremio.net/page/view.aspx?i=copa_2001&language=0 |title=Portal Oficial do Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense – 3.7.1.

Tite would remain with the ''Tricolor Gaúcho'' until 2003, leaving the club after failing to lead the club to any substantial victory after the 2001 Copa do Brasil. Grêmio reached the third place at both the [[2002 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A]] and the [[2002 Copa Libertadores]], but led Grêmio to a lackluster campaign during the year of 2003, which led to his departure from the club, exacerbated by his long spell as coach.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://esportes.terra.com.br/futebol/noticias/0,,OI176533-EI17400,00-Dirigentes+dizem+que+Tite+estava+desgastado+no+Gremio.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708214311/http://esportes.terra.com.br/futebol/noticias/0,,OI176533-EI17400,00-Dirigentes+dizem+que+Tite+estava+desgastado+no+Gremio.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 July 2012 |title=Dirigentes dizem que Tite estava desgastado no Grêmio |publisher=Esportes.terra.com.br }}</ref>

===Leaving Rio Grande do Sul; Spells in São Paulo, Minas Gerais, and foreign clubs===
Tite was hired by [[São Caetano do Sul]] club [[Associação Desportiva São Caetano]] in 2003, with the goal of taking the ''azulão'' to the Copa Libertadores qualifying zone.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esportes.terra.com.br/noticias/0,,OI180833-EI2017,00-Tite+chega+ao+Sao+Caetano.html |title=Tite chega ao São Caetano |publisher=Esportes.terra.com.br |date=31 July 2003}}</ref> Leading the team to a good campaign, São Caetano reached the fourth place in the league table, qualifying itself to the [[2004 Copa Libertadores]], being routed at the quarter-finals by [[Boca Juniors]], after drawing both games and losing on penalty kicks. Tite, however, had been fired by the club and replaced with [[Muricy Ramalho]] before the [[2004 Campeonato Paulista]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esportes.terra.com.br/noticias/0,,OI276682-EI2017,00-Muricy+lamenta+situacao+do+Sao+Caetano.html |title=Muricy lamenta situação do São Caetano |publisher=Esportes.terra.com.br |date=23 January 2013}}</ref>

Tite also coached [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista|Corinthians]] (2004–2005), [[Clube Atlético Mineiro|Atlético Mineiro]] (2005), [[Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras|Palmeiras]] (2006), and [[Al Ain Club|Al Ain]] (2007).

===Internacional===
Tite was signed in 2008 to Internacional, despite the protests of the ''colorado'' supporters, who resented the presence of the former coach of their rivals, Grêmio, as the club manager.

Since then, Tite led the club to a sixth-place finish in the [[2008 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A]], and won the [[2008 Copa Sudamericana]] over Argentine club [[Estudiantes de La Plata]], eliminating important Latin American clubs such as [[Club Deportivo Universidad Católica|Universidad Católica]], Boca Juniors and [[Chivas Guadalajara]] along the way.

Under Tite's command, Internacional also won the [[2009 Campeonato Gaúcho]] over Grêmio and reached the [[2009 Copa do Brasil]] finals, losing against Corinthians but knocking clubs such as [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]] and [[Coritiba FC|Coritiba]] out of the competition. Internacional were the runners-up of the [[2009 Recopa Sudamericana]], losing against [[LDU Quito]] in the finals. In the same year, Internacional won the [[2009 Suruga Bank Championship]], defeating Japanese club [[Oita Trinita]].

In the [[2009 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|2009 season]], Internacional had a very good first half of the season, however its results greatly diminished during the second half, both in and out of the [[Beira-Rio]] stadium. Tite was then fired by the directors of the club on 5 October.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.abril.com.br/noticias/esportes/direcao-internacional-anuncia-demissao-tite-551765.shtml |access-date=2023-05-20 |title=Archived |archive-date=December 21, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131221172606/http://www.abril.com.br/noticias/esportes/direcao-internacional-anuncia-demissao-tite-551765.shtml}}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.internacional.com.br/pagina.php?modulo=2&setor=18&codigo=9803 |title=Site oficial do Sport Club Internacional – Coletiva explica saída do técnico Tite – 05/10/2009 |publisher=Internacional.com.br }}</ref>

===Brief stay at Al-Wahda and return to Corinthians===
Tite was signed by Emirati side [[Al Wahda S.C.C.|Al Wahda]]. Tite's stay was brief, as he was approached by his former club, Corinthians, to replace coach [[Adilson Batista]], who had left the team.<ref>{{cite web |author=Olá |url=http://esportes.r7.com/futebol/times/corinthians/area-publica/noticias/tite-recebe-liberacao-do-al-wahda-e-chega-nesta-semana-para-assumir-o-corinthians-20101017.html |title=Tite recebe liberação do Al Wahda e chega nesta semana para assumir o Corinthians – Corinthians – R7 |publisher=Esportes.r7.com |access-date=22 February 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101020023321/http://esportes.r7.com/futebol/times/corinthians/area-publica/noticias/tite-recebe-liberacao-do-al-wahda-e-chega-nesta-semana-para-assumir-o-corinthians-20101017.html |archive-date=20 October 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>

====Campeonato Brasileiro 2010====
Tite returned to Corinthians in a complicated moment, as the club's battle for the [[2010 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A]] title had been derailed by a 10-game dry spell, which caused the sacking of previous coach Adilson Batista with eight matches still to be played in the season. In spite of not winning the tournament, losing the title at the final round of the season after a draw against [[Goiás Esporte Clube|Goiás]] from [[Goiânia]], Corinthians had a solid campaign under Tite, remaining unbeaten through the final matches of the season, and finishing at a respectable third place, earning a berth at the [[2011 Copa Libertadores]] first stage and cementing Tite's position.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.meutimao.com.br/jogo/05-12-2010/brasileirao_2010/goias-1-x-1-corinthians |title=Brasileirсo 2010 – Goias 1&nbsp;×&nbsp;1 Corinthians |publisher=Meutimao.com.br |access-date=22 February 2012}}</ref>

====Defeat in the Libertadores Cup====
After an uneventful debut at the [[2011 Campeonato Paulista]], defeating [[Portuguesa de Desportos|Portuguesa]] 2–0, the Corinthians squad prepared itself for its matches against [[Deportes Tolima]] for the preliminary stage of the Copa Libertadores. Drawing 0–0 at the [[Estádio do Pacaembu]], Tite's squad raised suspicions with the fans and the press, as the preliminary stage of the continental competition was widely seen in Brazil as a preamble to the real competition, not being a proper part of it.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/esportes,corinthians-so-empata-com-goias-e-tera-que-disputar-pre-libertadores,649838,0.htm |title=Corinthians só empata com Goiás e terá que disputar pré-Libertadores – esportes – futebol – Estadão |publisher=Estadao.com.br |access-date=22 February 2012}}</ref> With the moral obligation of winning the away leg of the match in [[Estadio Manuel Murillo Toro]] at [[Ibagué]], Colombia, Corinthians was under intense scrutiny of their supporters and detractors. Playing poorly against the Colombian squad, barely finishing or generating goal scoring opportunities, Tolima defeated Corinthians 2–0, inciting fury among supporters, the mockery of rival fans, and a crisis in the [[São Paulo]] team, as Corinthians was the first Brazilian team not to advance in the "Pré-Libertadores", as the preliminary stage of the cup is known.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esportes.terra.com.br/futebol/libertadores/2011/noticias/0,,OI4926822-EI17180,00-Corinthians+perde+do+Tolima+e+tem+queda+historica+na+PreLibertadores.html |title=Corinthians perde do Tolima e tem queda histórica na Pré-Libertadores |publisher=Esportes.terra.com.br |access-date=22 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/esportes,corintianos-apedrejam-area-de-entrada-do-clube-apos-eliminacao,674699,0.htm |title=Corintianos apedrejam área de entrada do clube após eliminação – esportes – futebol – Estadão |publisher=Estadao.com.br |access-date=22 February 2012}}</ref> Despite the wide demand of the fans to fire him, club president [[Andrés Sánchez (footballer)|Andrés Sánchez]] reinforced the fact that Tite was still the coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/esportes,sob-pressao-tite-e-garantido-no-cargo-por-andres,674794,0.htm |title=Sob pressão, Tite é garantido no cargo por Andrés – esportes – futebol – Estadão |publisher=Estadao.com.br |access-date=22 February 2012}}</ref>

====2011 Campeonato Paulista====
Soon after its Libertadores defeat, Corinthians had to face their rivals, Palmeiras, on the [[2011 Campeonato Paulista|Campeonato Paulista]]. With Tite's job on the line, Corinthians won the derby by 1 goal to 0. Picking up important victories on the competition, Corinthians had qualified to the final stage of the ''Paulistão'', defeating [[Oeste de Itápolis|Oeste]] in the quarter-finals, Palmeiras in the semi-finals, and drawing against [[Santos FC|Santos]] on the first leg of the finals. Santos, however, won 2–1 in the second leg of the final match, winning their second state title in a row.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esporte.ig.com.br/futebol/2010/05/02/em+jogo+emocionante+santos+perde+mas+e+campeao+paulista+9474954.html |title=Em jogo emocionante, Santos perde, mas é campeão paulista – iG Esporte / Futebol – IG |publisher=Esporte.ig.com.br |access-date=22 February 2012}}</ref>

====2011 Campeonato Brasileiro====
Off to an impressive start on the [[2011 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Brasileirão]] with a ten-game undefeated streak, Corinthians spent most of the first half of the 2011 season as the leader of the competition, in spite of moments of instability, such as its defeats against [[Avaí Futebol Clube|Avaí]] and rivals Palmeiras, coupled with draws against lower table clubs such as [[Ceará Sporting Club|Ceará]].<ref>{{cite web |author=dom, 28/08/11 |url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/platb/olhotatico/2011/08/28/corinthians-campeao-irreal-do-primeiro-turno/ |title=olhotatico » Corinthians, "campeão" irreal do primeiro turno » Arquivo |publisher=Globoesporte.globo.com |access-date=22 February 2012 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111220053342/http://globoesporte.globo.com/platb/olhotatico/2011/08/28/corinthians-campeao-irreal-do-primeiro-turno |archive-date=20 December 2011 }}</ref>
 
With a diminished performance during the second half of the season, Tite's job as a coach was being questioned by the fans, after repeated losses and a two-loss streak against Fluminense and Santos. The club president, Andrés Sanchez, did not budge and kept backing Tite's status as manager. Facing São Paulo in a derby match, Tite decided to remove club captain, the defender [[Anderson Sebastião Cardoso|Chicão]] from the starting 11. The match ended in a goalless draw, quelling the demands of the fans and helping maintain Tite's managing position. Earning important, but sometimes lackluster, results, including a 0–0 draw against direct competitors for the title [[CR Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]], Tite's Corinthians went on undefeated until the 29th round, when it lost to [[Botafogo Futebol e Regatas|Botafogo]]. In the 33rd round, Corinthians lost against [[América Futebol Clube (MG)|América-MG]], in a great upset. América, virtually relegated and firmly entrenched on the last place of the league, played at home, but decided to sell all of their game tickets to the opposing fans to improve finances, as América's matches typically had very low fan attendance. In front of a capacity crowd of ''corintianos'', América defeated Corinthians 2–1, finally improving its condition on the league table. With five games to go until the end of the season, the demands for Tite's departure were mounting, and were once again quelled by a winning streak.

In the penultimate match of the competition, Corinthians needed a win against [[Figueirense FC|Figueirense]] and it needed Vasco da Gama to draw against Fluminense in order to become champions of the 2011 season. Routing the [[Florianópolis]] team with ease, ''Coringão'' was virtually the champion, as Vasco drew against Fluminense during the [[Rio de Janeiro]] derby. In the final minute of the match, however, Vasco scored, interrupting the celebrations of the São Paulo club, pushing the championship definition to the next and final round, on the coming Sunday.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://esportes.br.msn.com/fotos/galeria-de-fotos-photopage-msn.aspx?cp-documentid=31505280 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120708071353/http://esportes.br.msn.com/fotos/galeria-de-fotos-photopage-msn.aspx?cp-documentid=31505280 |url-status=dead |archive-date=8 July 2012 |title=Figueirense x Corinthians – Brasileirão – Por dentro da 37ª rodada – Fotos |publisher=Esportes.br.msn.com |date=26 November 2011 |access-date=22 February 2012 }}</ref>

Leading the league tables by the final round, Corinthians had 70 points and a higher win ratio, while Vasco had 68 points. Needing only a draw against bitter rivals Palmeiras to be consecrated as champions, Corinthians was in a better position than Vasco, who needed to defeat Flamengo and for Corinthians to lose against Palmeiras.<ref>{{cite web|last=Vooght |first=Luke |url=http://www.sambafoot.com/en/news/26318_scolari__corinthians_are_already_the_champions.html |title=Scolari: Corinthians are already the champions – Sambafoot.com, all About Brazilian Football |publisher=Sambafoot.com |date=1 December 2011 |access-date=22 February 2012}}</ref> Vasco did not manage to defeat Rio rivals Flamengo, and Corinthians drew against Palmeiras in a tense game, winning the Campeonato Brasileiro.

Tite was praised by the press for his persistence and his important tactical changes during the matches, and for promoting two important overhauls in the club, the first after the Libertadores defeat, and the second after the ''Paulistão'' finals loss.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://zerohora.clicrbs.com.br/rs/esportes/brasileirao/noticia/2011/12/uma-divida-pessoal-paga-afirma-tite-sobre-o-titulo-brasileiro-3590899.html |title=Uma dívida pessoal paga, afirma Tite sobre o título brasileiro – Brasileirão – ZH Esportes |date=9 December 2011 |publisher=Zerohora.clicrbs.com.br |access-date=22 February 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author =Daniel Augusto Jr./Fotoarena |url=http://veja.abril.com.br/noticia/esporte/receita-de-campeao |title=Tite: a receita para ser campeão - Esporte - Notícia - VEJA.com |publisher=Veja.abril.com.br |access-date=22 February 2012}}</ref>

====2012 Copa Libertadores====
After a turbulent elimination in the [[2012 Campeonato Paulista]], in which Corinthians were eliminated in the playoffs by [[AA Ponte Preta|Ponte Preta]], Tite managed the club to their first ever Libertadores title in an unbeaten campaign, defeating Boca Juniors in the [[2012 Copa Libertadores Finals|finals]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/br/news/619/especiais/2012/07/07/3225976/corinthians-os-momentos-inesquec%C3%ADveis-do-t%C3%ADtulo-invicto-da |title=Corinthians: Os momentos inesquecíveis do título invicto da Libertadores |language=pt |publisher=Goal.com }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/news/newsid=1660813/?intcmp=newsreader_news_caption |archive-url=https://archive.today/20130102154138/http://www.fifa.com/clubworldcup/news/newsid=1660813/?intcmp=newsreader_news_caption |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 January 2013 |title=Corinthians, the cream of South America |date=5 July 2012 |work=FIFA.com |access-date=10 July 2012 }}</ref>

[[File:Corinthians celebrate FIFA Club World Cup win (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Tite in 2012]]
Entering the [[2012 FIFA Club World Cup]] as the reigning [[CONMEBOL|South American]] champions, Corinthians earned a berth in the semi-finals against Egyptian club [[Al Ahly SC|Al Ahly]], the reigning [[2012 CAF Champions League]] champions. Edging the Africans 1–0, Tite's defensive, possession-based tactics were called into question, especially after the tense second half of the game which saw the Egyptians create many goalscoring chances.<ref>{{cite web |author=0 – 1 FT |url=http://espnfc.com/en/gamecast/358018/gamecast.html?soccernet=true&cc=3888 |title=Al Ahly v Corinthians live football scores &#124; Soccer scores and live video |publisher=ESPNFC.com |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130620133928/http://espnfc.com/en/gamecast/358018/gamecast.html?soccernet=true&cc=3888 |archive-date=20 June 2013 }}</ref>

Advancing to the [[2012 FIFA Club World Cup Final|final]], Corinthians were to face the [[2011–12 UEFA Champions League|champions of Europe]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]. The two teams were in deeply different stages of morale and form – Chelsea interim manager [[Rafael Benítez]] was being heavily contested by the supporters; the captain of the team, [[John Terry]], was out due to injury; and the team's main striker, [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup winner]] [[Fernando Torres]], was in poor form. Tite's squad lacked individual quality and talent, but was fine-tuned tactically and enjoyed a heavy boost of morale.<ref>{{cite web |author=Fábio Sormani |url=http://esportes.terra.com.br/blog-do-sormani/blog/2012/12/16/campeao-do-mundo-corinthians-prova-que-futebol-europeu-e-menos-do-que-se-imagina/ |title=Campeão Do Mundo, Corinthians Prova Que Futebol Europeu É Menos Do Que Se Imagina &#124; Blog Do Sormani |publisher=Esportes.terra.com.br |date=15 April 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119104309/http://esportes.terra.com.br/blog-do-sormani/blog/2012/12/16/campeao-do-mundo-corinthians-prova-que-futebol-europeu-e-menos-do-que-se-imagina/ |archive-date=19 January 2013 }}</ref> The match saw the young goalkeeper [[Cássio (goalkeeper)|Cássio]] save many dangerous shots, and Corinthians won after striker [[Paolo Guerrero]] scored a header against [[Petr Čech]], winning Corinthians its second World Club Cup title, as well as Tite's first.<ref>{{cite web|author =Ian McCourt |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/dec/16/chelsea-corinthians-club-world-cup-live |title=Chelsea v Corinthians – as it happened&#124; Ian McCourt &#124; Football &#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date=16 December 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author =1 – 0 FT |url=http://espnfc.com/uk/en/report/358021/report.html?soccernet=true&cc=5739 |title=Corinthians v Chelsea live football scores &#124; Soccer scores and live video |publisher=ESPNFC.com }}</ref>

====2013 and leaving Corinthians====
Despite winning [[2013 Campeonato Paulista|State of São Paulo League]] and [[2013 Recopa Sudamericana|Recopa Sudamericana]], 2013 was not a good year for Corinthians. The club was eliminated in [[2013 Copa Libertadores|Copa Libertadores]], where they unsuccessfully tried to defend their title, had a poor campaign at the [[2013 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Brazilian League]] and also lost [[2013 Copa do Brasil|Brazilian Cup]] after a penalty was missed by [[Alexandre Pato]], arguably the main signing of that season.

Although supported by most Corinthians fans, Tite announced that his contract with the club would not be renewed on 14 November. [[Mano Menezes]] (former [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national team]] head coach and Corithians president Mario Gobbi's friend) return as ''Alvinegro'''s coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.estadao.com.br/noticias/esportes,tite-nao-vai-renovar-com-o-corinthians-mano-menezes-esta-a-caminho,1096744,0.htm |title=Tite não vai renovar com o Corinthians.

===Sabbatical year===
After leaving Corinthians, Tite decided to focus on studying modern football. He received offers, but declined them in favour of his studies. He watched several games (including games from the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]]) and visited some clubs as part of that refinement, including [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]]<ref>{{cite web|title=O estudioso Tite: livros em três idiomas, viagens e fissura por tática|url=http://esporte.uol.com.br/futebol/ultimas-noticias/2014/10/08/o-estudioso-tite-livros-em-tres-idiomas-viagens-e-fissura-por-tatica.htm|website=esporte.uol.com.br|access-date=15 December 2014}}</ref> and [[Carlo Ancelotti]]'s [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Tite volta da Espanha entusiasmado com métodos de Ancelotti|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/blogs/especial-blog/bastidores-fc/post/tite-volta-da-espanha-entusiasmado-com-metodos-de-ancelotti.html|website=globoesporte.globo.com/blogs/especial-blog/bastidores-fc/1.html|access-date=15 December 2014}}</ref> He was expected to be appointed as Brazil's new coach and was even approached by [[Japan national football team|Japan]], but [[Dunga]] was selected as Brazil's coach and Tite did not go through negotiations with Japan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Tite admite frustração com Seleção Brasileira e explica recusa ao Japão|url=http://diariocatarinense.clicrbs.com.br/sc/esportes/noticia/2014/08/tite-admite-frustracao-com-selecao-brasileira-e-explica-recusa-ao-japao-4574953.html|website=diariocatarinense.clicrbs.com.br|access-date=15 December 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141220155657/http://diariocatarinense.clicrbs.com.br/sc/esportes/noticia/2014/08/tite-admite-frustracao-com-selecao-brasileira-e-explica-recusa-ao-japao-4574953.html|archive-date=20 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref>
