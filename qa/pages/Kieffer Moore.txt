'''Kieffer Roberto Francisco Moore''' (born 8 August 1992) is a professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]] for {{English football updater|AFCBourn}} club [[AFC Bournemouth]] and the [[Wales national football team|Wales national team]].

Moore started his career with [[Conference South]] club [[Truro City F.C.|Truro City]], having as a teen been a part of [[Torquay United F.C.|Torquay United]]'s youth system and playing for [[South Devon Football League|South Devon League]] Division Two club Paignton Saints. Moore joined [[Dorchester Town F.C.|Dorchester Town]] in February 2013 due to Truro's continued financial difficulties, and he finished his first season in the Conference South with 20 goals. His goal-scoring record brought him to the attention of [[Yeovil Town F.C.|Yeovil Town]] for whom he signed in July 2013.

After making more than fifty appearances for Yeovil, Moore was released and had a brief spell with Norwegian club [[Viking FK|Viking]] before returning to English football with [[Forest Green Rovers F.C.|Forest Green Rovers]]. Moore had a loan spell back at his hometown club Torquay United where he scored five goals in four games, grabbing the attention of Championship club [[Ipswich Town F.C.|Ipswich Town]], signing for the club in January 2017. Before the beginning of the 2017–18 season, Moore signed on loan for [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] for whom he scored 13 goals in 20 matches. His form saw him recalled by Ipswich in January 2018, and he subsequently joined fellow Championship club [[Barnsley F.C.|Barnsley]] for an undisclosed fee.

Born in England, Moore played once for their [[England national football C team|non-league select team]] in 2016 but was eligible for [[Wales]] and [[China]] through ancestral affiliations, before making his senior debut for Wales in 2019; he was selected subsequently for the Welsh [[UEFA Euro 2020]] finals squad and scored on his first appearance at the tournament. Moore also helped Wales qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in 2022 for the first time since 1958.

==International career==
Moore was born in England and represented England C on a single occasion in 2016, however later chose to commit to Wales at senior international level.

Moore is eligible for the [[Wales national football team|Wales national team]] through his paternal grandfather, who hailed from [[Llanrug]]. The [[Chinese Football Association]], however, had tried to get contact with the hope to get Moore into the [[China national football team|Chinese team]], using the Chinese ancestry of his maternal great-grandfather, who hailed from [[Guangdong]] before migrating to [[Liverpool]] in the 1940s (although great-grandparent is not a completely valid international qualification); Moore later arrived at [[Beijing]] to discuss the matter in 2019 but the move failed to materialise.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2021/jun/01/kieffer-moore-the-wales-forward-whose-fortunes-changed-in-28-days-at-torquay|title = Kieffer Moore: Wales forward whose fortunes changed at Torquay|website = [[TheGuardian.com]]|date = June 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/sport/football/article/3137219/euro-2020-marko-arnautovic-goal-makes-history-chinese-super-league|title = Euro 2020: Arnautovic goal makes history for Chinese Super League|date = 15 June 2021}}</ref> Moore is also of Italian descent.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/football/2022/08/05/kieffer-moore-exclusive-premier-league-always-destiny-even/|title= Kieffer Moore exclusive: 'The Premier League was always my destiny – even when I was a lifeguard'|date=5 August 2022|publisher=Telegraph}}</ref>
