Courtois began his career with [[K.R.C.

Courtois made his senior international debut for Belgium in 2011 at age 19, becoming their youngest senior international goalkeeper. He has since earned over 100 caps, ranking [[Belgium national football team records and statistics#General|seventh-highest]] for appearances, while he has appeared in five major tournaments.

==Club career==
===Early career===
Courtois was born in the city of [[Bree, Belgium|Bree]] in [[Flanders]], to a [[Walloons|Walloon]] father and a [[Flemings|Flemish]] mother.<ref name="theguardian1">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/aug/30/thibaut-courtois-atletico-madrid-chelsea|title = All right on the night for Atlético Madrid's Chelsea-owned keeper|website = [[TheGuardian.com]]|date = 30 August 2012}}</ref> He began his career with local side Bilzen V.V.,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kbilzersevv.be/ |title=K.Bilzerse-Waltwilder VV |website=kbilzersevv.be}}</ref> as a [[left back]].

===Genk===
[[File:Thibaut Courtois.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Courtois with [[KRC Genk|Genk]] during the 2010–11 season]]

Courtois progressed through the [[KRC Genk|Genk]] youth system, where [[Koen Casteels]] was initially regarded as the primary goalkeeper, but during an injury crisis Courtois, aged 16 years and 341 days, made his first team debut on 17 April 2009 against [[KAA Gent|Gent]]. After turning down a transfer to [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim]] of the [[Bundesliga]], Courtois was made first-choice goalkeeper for the 2010–11 season ahead of Casteels, when [[Laszlo Koteles]]' registration ran into issues.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Terreur |first1=Kristof |title=Chelsea's Thibaut Courtois: from clumsy boy to top of the world |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/20/chelsea-thibaut-courtois-profile |access-date=12 July 2018 |newspaper=The Observer |date=20 September 2014}}</ref>

He was a key figure in Genk's title victory in the [[2010–11 Belgian Pro League|2010–11 season in the Belgian Pro League]]. He received the Goalkeeper of the Year and Genk's Player of the Year award, only conceding 32 goals over the course of 40 league matches and keeping 14 [[clean sheet]]s for Genk.<ref>{{cite web |title=Courtois History |url=http://www.101greatgoals.com/blog/video-evidence-thibaut-courtois-genks-19-year-old-goalie-who-chelsea-man-united-spurs-newcastle-all-want/ |publisher=101 Great Goals |access-date=28 June 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://hosted.stats.com/belg/players.asp?player=90824 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406062606/http://hosted.stats.com/belg/players.asp?player=90824 |archive-date=6 April 2012 |title=STATS Hosted Solution &#124; Player Stats – Thibaut Courtois – Racing Genk |publisher=Hosted.stats.com |access-date=27 April 2012}}</ref>

When Atlético were drawn to play Chelsea in the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League knockout phase#Semi-finals|Champions League semi-final]], it was reported that a clause in Courtois' contract required Atlético to pay Chelsea €3&nbsp;million per match if they selected him against his parent club, and that Atlético could not afford such a sum. UEFA made it clear that considerations of sporting integrity made such a clause "null, void and unenforceable", and confirmed that Atlético were free to select Courtois without making any such payment.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://as.com/diarioas/2014/04/10/english/1397147582_658656.html |title=Atlético have to pay to play Courtois if they draw Chelsea |first=Dani |last=Hidalgo |newspaper=Diario AS |date=10 April 2014 |access-date=15 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/26972498 |title=Chelsea: Atletico keeper Thibaut Courtois cleared to play in semi |website=[[BBC Sport]] |date=10 April 2014 |access-date=15 May 2014}}</ref>

By conceding the fewest goals in a substantial number of matches during the 2013–14 season, Courtois won the [[Ricardo Zamora Trophy]] and made an important contribution to Atletico's 2013–14 La Liga title, their first since 1996.

==Outside football==
===Personal life===
Courtois speaks both Dutch and French, as well as Spanish and English.<ref name="theguardian1"/> Thibaut's older sister [[Valérie Courtois]] is a [[volleyball]] player who plays as a [[Libero (volleyball)|libero]] for Stade Français Paris Saint Cloud and [[Belgium women's national volleyball team|Belgium]].<ref name="fivb">{{cite web |title=Getting to know: Belgium "Yellow Tiger" Valérie Courtois |url=http://www.fivb.org/viewPressRelease.asp?No=44886&Language=en |publisher=FIVB.org |access-date=3 November 2014}}</ref> His parents were volleyball players, and he played the sport in his childhood but decided to focus on football when he was 12.<ref name="fivb" />

On 26 May 2015, his Spanish girlfriend Marta Domínguez gave birth to their daughter, Adriana.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.nieuwsblad.be/sportwereld/cnt/dmf20150528_01703820 |title=Thibaut Courtois stuurt eerste foto van dochtertje de wereld in |author=krli |newspaper=[[Het Nieuwsblad]] |language=nl |date=29 May 2015 |access-date=10 June 2015}}</ref> The couple ended their relationship in April 2017 while Domínguez was pregnant with their son Nicolás, who was born a month later.<ref>{{cite news |title=Thibaut Courtois rompe con su novia española|trans-title=Thibaut Courtois breaks up with his Spanish girlfriend |url=https://as.com/tikitakas/2017/04/03/portada/1491237668_279229.html |access-date=30 April 2018 |newspaper=Diario AS |date=3 April 2017 |language=es}}</ref>

===In popular culture===
Inspired by Courtois' pose from a particular save in January 2013, a Colombian fan created a new widespread social media meme called 'Thibauting' to pay homage to the Belgian goalkeeper.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sporza.be/cm/sporza/extra/opvallend/1.1530266 |publisher=[[Sporza]] |title=Courtois speelt mee met eigen internethype: Thibauting |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825134843/http://sporza.be/cm/sporza/extra/opvallend/1.1530266|date=21 January 2013 |archive-date=25 August 2013}}</ref> In November 2013, the word was included in a shortlist composed by leading Dutch dictionary ''[[Van Dale]]'' to be polled to determine the best new sports/amusement word of the year in Belgium,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.standaard.be/cnt/dmf20131126_00857805 |title=Wordt Thibauting 'Sportwoord van het Jaar'? |language=nl |newspaper=[[De Standaard]] |date=26 November 2013 |access-date=1 September 2014}}</ref> and ended second.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://woordvanhetjaar.vandale.be/ |title=Hét Woord van het Jaar 2013 is bekend! |language=nl |publisher=[[Van Dale]] |access-date=1 September 2014}}</ref> The term is based on and pronounced the same way as "[[Tebowing]]", and is also similar to the worldwide '[[Planking (fad)|planking]]' meme which was popular in 2011.

In 2021, Courtois participated in the 2021 F1 Virtual Grand Prix championship as an [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] driver.<ref>{{Cite web|title=2021 Virtual Austrian Grand Prix: Race Highlights - YouTube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZHBXzA8rmPw|access-date=31 January 2021|website=www.youtube.com}}</ref>

===Controversies===
In February 2014, Courtois caused some stir in the national team, by saying of [[Simon Mignolet]], his rival for the starting goalkeeper spot, "You have to know how to stay humble and respectful, and he should remember that."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/02/07/chelseas-thibaut-courtois-blasts-disrespectful-liverpool-stopper-simon-mignolet-in-belgium-no-1-battle-4294727 |title=Chelsea's Thibaut Courtois blasts 'disrespectful' Liverpool stopper Simon Mignolet in Belgium no.1 battle |date=7 February 2014 |newspaper=Metro}}</ref> This was despite the fact that in previous interviews, Mignolet had only said that it was his ambition to keep working and try to regain his spot in the national team.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.voetbalnieuws.be/news/94071/Mignolet:_Er_kan_maar_%C3%A9%C3%A9n_doelman_spelen%E2%80%A6 |title=Mignolet: "Er kan maar één doelman spelen..." |last=Reulens |first=Claudio |date=1 January 2014 |website=Voetbalnieuws.be |language=nl}}</ref>

In April 2018, Wilmots, by then out of a job, accused Courtois and his father Thierry of leaking Belgium's line-ups before they should have been revealed to the public. He denied the allegations.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.eurosport.fr/football/euro-2016/2016/marc-wilmots-attaque-le-pere-de-thibaut-courtois-il-a-vendu-la-selection_sto6726196/story.shtml |title=Marc Wilmots attaque le père de Thibaut Courtois : "Il a vendu la sélection" |last1=Maillard-Pacini |first1=Guillaume |date=24 April 2018 |access-date=24 April 2018 |publisher=Eurosport|trans-title=Marc Wilmots attacks Thibaut Courtois' father: "He sold the line-up"}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/chelsea-keeper-courtois-faces-belgium-mole-accusations/14q9tc3drf4pm1hmetpua7u3ik |title=Chelsea keeper Courtois faces Belgium mole accusations |last1=Burton |first1=Chris |date=24 April 2018 |access-date=24 April 2018 |publisher=Goal.com}}</ref>
