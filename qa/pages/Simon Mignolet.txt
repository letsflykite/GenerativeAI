He was also named to Belgium's squad for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]], [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], and [[UEFA Euro 2016]] and [[UEFA Euro 2020|2020]].

==Club career==
===Sint-Truiden===
Mignolet was born in [[Sint-Truiden]]. He first joined his local football team, [[Belgian Second Division]] side [[K. Sint-Truidense V.V.|Sint-Truiden]], in 2004, eventually rising through their youth system to become their first-choice goalkeeper in 2006 at age 18 after the departure of [[Dušan Belić]]. In 2009, he made 29 appearances and scored a penalty in the league, as he helped Sint-Truiden to win the [[Belgian Second Division]], and was named [[Belgian professional football awards|Belgian Goalkeeper of the Year]] the following year after he helped Sint-Truiden avoid relegation.

===Sunderland===

After being invited for a training ground tour, Mignolet signed a five-year contract with English [[Premier League]] club [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] on 17 June 2010 in a deal worth £2&nbsp;million.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/jun/17/sunderland-sign-simon-mignolet|title=Sunderland sign Belgium Under-21 goalkeeper Simon Mignolet|date=17 June 2010|work=[[The Guardian]]|access-date=16 January 2018}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.safc.com/news/20100617/mignolet-on-dream-move_2256213_2073163 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100619141456/http://www.safc.com/news/20100617/mignolet-on-dream-move_2256213_2073163 |title=Mignolet on dream move |publisher=Sunderland A.F.C |date=17 June 2010 |access-date=26 June 2013 |archive-date=19 June 2010}}</ref> It was later confirmed by Sint-Truiden that Sunderland had beaten [[PSV Eindhoven|PSV]], [[FC Twente|Twente]] and [[Udinese Calcio|Udinese]] to secure Mignolet's signature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/462/netherlands/2010/03/29/1854728/there-has-been-no-contact-between-psv-and-simon-mignolet|title=FINISHED: No Contact Yet Between PSV And Simon Mignolet|date=29 March 2010|publisher=Goal.com}}</ref>

Mignolet made his Sunderland debut in a 2–2 draw against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] on 15 August 2010, and was named man of the match for his performance. In the next home match, a 1–0 victory against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], Mignolet kept his first clean sheet for Sunderland, following an excellent reaction save to deny [[Emmanuel Adebayor]] a goal. Mignolet put in another fine performance against [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], as Sunderland drew 1–1 after [[Darren Bent]] equalised in the 95th minute. However, [[Craig Gordon]] would replace Mignolet in goal several weeks later, and remained first-choice thereafter. Mignolet did not feature again until 8 January 2011, when Sunderland suffered a loss at home to [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] in the third round of the [[FA Cup]]. Mignolet would become first-choice goalkeeper again after a knee injury to Gordon in February, and earned a string of rave reviews for his performances.{{citation needed|date=February 2019}} Following the draw, Sunderland manager [[Steve Bruce]] hailed the young goalkeeper's fine start to life in English football.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/en-gb/news/2896/premier-league/2011/03/05/2380907/sunderland-boss-steve-bruce-hails-performance-of-goalkeeper|title=Sunderland boss Steve Bruce hails performance of goalkeeper Simon Mignolet after draw with Arsenal - Goal.com|date=5 March 2011}}</ref> Mignolet cemented his position as first-choice goalkeeper the following season, being preferred to new signing [[Keiren Westwood]].<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/8695430/Liverpool-1-Sunderland-1-match-report.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Rory | last=Smith | title=Liverpool 1 Sunderland 1: match report | date=13 August 2011}}</ref>
