'''Didier Claude Deschamps''' ({{IPA-fr|didje klod deʃɑ̃}};<ref>{{cite video|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=KkzXOc90NUA | archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/varchive/youtube/20211114/KkzXOc90NUA| archive-date=14 November 2021 | url-status=live|title=Didier Deschamps - How To Pronounce - French Native Speaker|author= Panda Speaks French |via=youtube.com |date=8 June 2018 |access-date=29 June 2021}}{{cbignore}}</ref> born 15 October 1968) is a French professional [[Association football|football]] manager and former player who has been managing the [[France national football team|France national team]] since 2012. He played as a [[defensive midfielder]] for several clubs, in France, Italy, England and Spain, namely [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] and [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], as well as [[FC Nantes|Nantes]] and [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]]. Nicknamed "the water-carrier" ({{lang-fr|le porteur d'eau}}) by former France teammate [[Eric Cantona]], Deschamps was an intelligent and hard-working defensive midfielder who excelled at winning back possession and subsequently starting attacking plays, and also stood out for his leadership throughout his career. As a French international, he was capped on 103 occasions and took part at three [[UEFA European Football Championships]] and one [[FIFA World Cup]], captaining his nation to victories in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]].

In addition to winning two [[Ligue 1]] titles in 1990 and 1992, Deschamps was part of the [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] squad that became the first, and so far only, [[Football in France|French]] club to win the [[UEFA Champions League]], a feat which the team achieved in [[1993 UEFA Champions League Final|1993]]; with the [[List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League winners|Champions League]] victory, Deschamps became the [[Captain (association football)|youngest captain]] ever to lead his team to win the title. With [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] he played three Champions League finals in a row between 1996 and 1998, winning the title in 1996. With the Turin side, he also won the [[UEFA Super Cup]] and the [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]], as well as three [[Serie A]] titles, among other trophies. With Chelsea, he won the [[1999–2000 FA Cup]], and also reached another Champions League final with Valencia in [[2001 UEFA Champions League Final|2001]], before retiring later that season. After [[Franz Beckenbauer]] and followed by [[Iker Casillas]], he was only the second captain in the history of football to have lifted the Champions League trophy, the World Cup trophy, and the European Championship trophy.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/deschamps-and-his-water-carriers |title=World Cup 2018: Didier Deschamps and his water carriers |publisher=www.sportskeeda.com |date=4 July 2018 |access-date=16 July 2018 }}</ref>

As a manager, Deschamps began his career with [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]], and helped the club to win the [[2003 Coupe de la Ligue Final|Coupe de la Ligue]] in 2003, and reached the [[2004 UEFA Champions League Final]], being named [[Trophées UNFP du football|Ligue 1 Manager of the Year]] in 2004. During the [[2006–07 Serie B|2006–07 season]], he helped his former club Juventus win the [[Serie B]] title and return to Serie A following their relegation due to their involvement in the [[2006 Calciopoli Scandal]] the previous season. He subsequently managed another one of his former clubs, Marseille, where he won the Ligue 1 title during the [[2009–10 Ligue 1|2009–10]] season, as well as three consecutive Coupe de la Ligue titles between 2010 and 2012, and consecutive [[Trophée des Champions]] titles in [[2010 Trophée des Champions|2010]] and [[2011 Trophée des Champions|2011]].

On 8 July 2012, Deschamps was named as the new manager of the [[France national football team|French national team]]. He led the team to the quarter-finals of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]], the final of [[UEFA Euro 2016]], victory in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], the last of these making Deschamps the third man to win the World Cup as both a player and a manager, and a back-to-back final appearance in the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]]. Alongside [[Mário Zagallo]] and [[Franz Beckenbauer]], Deschamps follows Beckenbauer as only the second to do so as captain.<ref name="World Cup as a manager and player">{{cite news |title=Who has won the World Cup as a manager and player? |url=https://www.si.com/soccer/2018/07/15/world-cup-wins-manager-player-zagallo-beckenbauer-deschamps |access-date=15 July 2018 |work=Sports Illustrated |date=15 July 2018 |language=en}}</ref>

==Club career==
[[File:Didier Deschamps.jpg|thumb|upright|Deschamps in 2000]]

Deschamps was born in [[Bayonne]] in the French part of the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque]] area. After a short passage at rugby in the [[Biarritz Olympique]] club, Deschamps started his football career at an amateur club, [[Aviron Bayonnais FC|Aviron Bayonnais]] whilst still at school. His potential was spotted by scouts from [[FC Nantes Atlantique|Nantes]], for whom he signed in April 1983. Deschamps made his league debut on 27 September 1985. He transferred to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] in 1989. Deschamps then spent a season on loan with [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]] in 1990, before returning to Marseille. In this second spell with Marseille, Deschamps gained his first honours as a professional player, winning two [[Ligue 1|Division 1]] titles in 1991 and 1992, and was a member of the first and only French side to win the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] in [[1993 UEFA Champions League Final|1993]], becoming the youngest captain ever to lift the trophy in the process.<ref name="candidates">{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/9271406/Early-candidates-in-the-frame-to-take-over-from-Kenny-Dalglish-at-Liverpool.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220112/https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/9271406/Early-candidates-in-the-frame-to-take-over-from-Kenny-Dalglish-at-Liverpool.html |archive-date=12 January 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Early candidates in the frame to take over from Kenny Dalglish at Liverpool |publisher=The Telegraph |author1=Alice Philipson |date=17 May 2012 |access-date=16 July 2018 }}{{cbignore}}</ref>

In 1994, Deschamps joined Italian club [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], with whom he won three [[Serie A]] titles, one [[Coppa Italia]], two [[Supercoppa Italiana]], as well as his second [[List of European Cup and UEFA Champions League winners|Champions League title]], a [[UEFA Super Cup]], and an [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] in 1996; he also reached two more Champions League finals in his next two seasons, and a [[1995 UEFA Cup final|UEFA Cup final in 1995]]. After his spell with Juventus, Deschamps spent a season in England with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], winning the [[FA Cup]], and scoring once against [[Hertha BSC]] in the Champions League.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-champions-league--chelseas-big-night-is-spoiled-by-sutton-1123414.html|title=Chelsea's big night is spoiled by Sutton|work=The Independent|date=3 November 1999|access-date=6 November 2009|first=Glenn|last=Moore}}</ref> He finished his playing career in Spain, spending a season with [[Valencia CF|Valencia]], helping them to the [[2001 UEFA Champions League final]], but he remained on the bench as they lost to [[FC Bayern Munich|Bayern Munich]]. He then retired in the middle of 2001, only 32 years old.

==International career==
{{BLP unreferenced section|date=March 2023}}[[File:Didier Deschamps France international player.jpg|thumb|upright|Deschamps with [[France national football team|France]] in 1996]]
Receiving his first international call-up from [[Michel Platini]] on 29 April 1989 against [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]], Deschamps started his international career in what was a dark time for the [[France national football team|France national team]] as they failed to qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in both 1990 and 1994, also suffering a first-round elimination at [[UEFA Euro 1992]].

When new team coach [[Aimé Jacquet]] began to rebuild the team for [[1996 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 96]], he initially selected [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] star [[Eric Cantona]] as captain. After Cantona earned a year-long suspension in January 1995, the make-up of the team changed dramatically, with veterans Cantona, [[Jean-Pierre Papin]], and [[David Ginola]] being dropped in favour of younger players such as [[Zinedine Zidane]]. Deschamps, as one of the few remaining veterans, was chosen to lead what would later be called the "Golden Generation". He first captained France in 1996 in a friendly match against [[Germany national football team|Germany]] as a warmup for Euro 96. During that tournament, held in England, he led them all the way to the semi-finals, their best finish in an international tournament since the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]].

In 1998, Deschamps captained France as they won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] on home soil in Paris, holding an integral role in the team. Propelled by the momentum of this triumph, Deschamps also captained France as they won [[2000 UEFA European Football Championship|Euro 2000]], giving them the distinction of being the first national team to hold both the World Cup and Euro titles since West Germany did so in 1974, a feat emulated and surpassed by the [[Spain national football team|Spain national team]] between 2008 and 2012. Following the tournament, Deschamps announced his retirement from international football, making his second last appearance in a ceremonial match against a [[FIFA]] XI in August 2000, which resulted in 5–1 victory. His final appearance was against [[England national football team|England]]. At the time of his retirement Deschamps held the record for the most appearances for France, though this has since been surpassed by [[Marcel Desailly]], Zinedine Zidane and [[Lilian Thuram]]. In total, Deschamps earned 103 caps and scored four goals.

Deschamps was named by [[Pelé]] as one of the [[FIFA 100|top 125 greatest living footballers]] in March 2004.

== Style of play ==
In his position, Deschamps primarily excelled at impeding the opposition's attacking movements as a defensive midfielder, and was capable of subsequently starting up attacking plays and distributing the ball to teammates once he won back possession, leading to him being derisively nicknamed "the water-carrier" by former France teammate Eric Cantona, who implied that Deschamps's primary contribution to the national team was to retrieve the ball and pass it forward to "more talented" players.<ref name= water-carrier>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/european/deschamps-the-water-carrier-is-now-monacos-man-of-ideas-71454.html|title=Football: Deschamps: the water carrier is now Monaco's man of ideas|work=The Independent|date=28 February 2004|access-date=1 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=profile>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/france/squad/744844.stm|title=Euro 2000 Profile: Didier Deschamps|publisher=BBC|access-date=11 September 2014}}</ref><ref name="come Giannichedda non c'e' nessuno">{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/1997/dicembre/04/all_Udinese_come_Giannichedda_non_ga_0_9712048347.shtml|title=all' Udinese come Giannichedda non c' e' nessuno|trans-title=At Udinese there's no-one like Giannichedda|publisher=La Gazzetta dello Sport|language=it|author1=Meroi Massimo|date=4 December 1997|access-date=18 November 2015}}</ref> Deschamps's ability to perform this role was made possible due to his high work-rate, tenacity, stamina, vision, reliable distribution and technique, and his efficacy at pressing and tackling opponents. He also had an excellent positional and organisational sense, and was known for his tactical intelligence, versatility, and his leadership as a footballer.<ref name="come Giannichedda non c'e' nessuno"/><ref name=tuttojuve>{{cite web|url=http://www.tuttojuve.com/gli-eroi-bianconeri/gli-eroi-in-bianconero-dider-deschamps-66190|title=Gli eroi in bianconero: Dider DESCHAMPS|publisher=Tutto Juve|language=it|author=Stefano Bedeschi|access-date=11 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/world-cup-winning-captains-xi-ss/7 |title=World Cup-winning captains XI |publisher=www.sportskeeda.com |author1=Anand Muralidharan |date=16 July 2018 |access-date=16 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180716194859/https://www.sportskeeda.com/football/world-cup-winning-captains-xi-ss/7 |archive-date=16 July 2018 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

== Managerial career ==

===Monaco===
After retiring as a player, he went into football management. He was appointed head coach of [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] in [[France]]'s [[Ligue 1]], leading the club to the [[Coupe de la Ligue|Coupe de la Ligue title]] [[2003 Coupe de la Ligue Final|in 2003]] and to its first [[2003–04 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]] [[2004 UEFA Champions League Final|final in 2004]]. He resigned on 19 September 2005 after a poor start to the season, and disagreement with the club's president.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sport/article/2005/09/19/l-as-monaco-accepte-la-demission-de-son-entraineur-didier-deschamps_690696_3242.html|title=L'AS Monaco accepte la démission de son entraîneur Didier Deschamps|newspaper=Le Monde.fr|publisher=lemonde|language=fr|date=19 September 2015|access-date=15 September 2015}}</ref>

===Juventus===
On 10 July 2006, Deschamps was named head coach of [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]], after [[Fabio Capello]] resigned in the wake of the [[2006 Italian football scandal|Calciopoli scandal]]. Deschamps' first game in charge of Juventus was highly successful since Juventus beat [[U.S. Alessandria Calcio 1912|Alessandria]] 8–0 in a friendly, but poor results followed as Juventus was knocked out in the [[2006–07 Coppa Italia|3rd round of the Coppa Italia]] and then drew 1–1 against [[A.C. Rimini 1912|Rimini]] on the first day of the league season. In the following three matches, Juventus beat [[Vicenza Calcio|Vicenza]] 2–1, [[F.C. Crotone|Crotone]] 3–0 and [[Modena F.C.|Modena]] 4–0. Deschamps also helped Juventus to win their first competition since being relegated, which was the [[Birra Moretti Cup]] in which Juventus beat [[F.C. Internazionale Milano|Internazionale]] 1–0 and [[S.S.C. Napoli|Napoli]] in a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]]. He led Juventus to its return to [[Serie A]], which was confirmed on 19 May 2007 with a 5–1 away win at [[A.C. Arezzo|Arezzo]]. On 26 May, several media announced Deschamps had resigned as Juventus manager, following several clashes with the club management.<ref name="deschamps out">{{cite news| title = Deschamps resigns as Juve coach| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/europe/6694425.stm| publisher = [[BBC Sport]]| date = 26 May 2007| access-date = 26 May 2007}}</ref> However, this was denied by the club itself a few hours later.<ref name="Juve deny quit claims">{{cite news| title = Nota della società| url = http://www.juventus.com/it/news/detail.aspx?lml_language_id=0&trs_id=1203000&ID=11387|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930185218/http://www.juventus.com/it/news/detail.aspx?lml_language_id=0&trs_id=1203000&ID=11387|archive-date=30 September 2007 |url-status=dead| publisher = Juventus.com| language = it| date = 26 May 2007| access-date = 26 May 2007}}</ref> Later that evening, after the game against [[A.C.

===Marseille===
[[File:Didier Deschamps 2011 (cropped).jpeg|thumb|upright|Deschamps as [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] manager in 2011]]

On 5 May 2009, it was announced that Deschamps would be named manager of [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] to the upcoming season which began on 1 July 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.om.net/fr/Saison/101002/Actualites/40123/Didier_Deschamps_succedera_a_Erik_Gerets|title=Didier Deschamps succèdera à Erik Gerets|publisher=OM.net|date=5 May 2009|access-date=14 June 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120818201745/http://www.om.net/fr/Saison/101002/Actualites/40123/Didier_Deschamps_succedera_a_Erik_Gerets|archive-date=18 August 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref> In his [[2009–10 Ligue 1|first season]], he managed them to their first [[Ligue 1]] title in 18 years.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/may/06/didier-deschamps-marseille-ligue-1-title|title=Didier Deschamps hails Marseille's 'extraordinary' Ligue 1 title win|work=The Guardian|date=6 May 2010|access-date=14 June 2012}}</ref> His success had seen the [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] manager linked to a return to [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] where former president [[Giovanni Cobolli Gigli]] urged the club to bring back Deschamps to replace [[Ciro Ferrara]].

On 29 June 2010, Deschamps signed a contract extension that would keep him at [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]] until June 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheminute.com/news/news.php?news=23710|title=Deschamps signs new Marseille deal|publisher=Ontheminute.com|date=29 June 2010|access-date=29 June 2010}}</ref> On 6 June 2011, he extended his contract again, this time until June 2014.

France was placed in [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group I|UEFA Group I]] for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualification phase of the 2014 FIFA World Cup]]. UEFA Group I contained the defending world champions Spain, plus [[Belarus national football team|Belarus]], [[Finland national football team|Finland]] and [[Georgia national football team|Georgia]]. In that group, France earned a 1–1 draw away in the first match against Spain but lost 1–0 at home against the same opponents in the second match. After the 1–0 defeat by Spain, France failed to score a single goal in its next four matches – against Uruguay (friendly, 1–0), [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] (friendly, 3–0), [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] (friendly, 0–0) and Georgia (Group I qualifying match, 0–0).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://fr.sports.yahoo.com/news/qualif-coupe-monde-2014-de-madrid-%C3%A0-tbilissi-170338873--sow.html|title=Qualif.

On 20 November 2013, Deschamps extended his contract to coach the [[France national football team]] until the [[UEFA Euro 2016]]. The extension was triggered under the terms of an agreement reached with the French Football Federation (FFF) when Deschamps replaced [[Laurent Blanc]] after the [[UEFA Euro 2012]], whereby qualification for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] would earn Deschamps the right to lead France until the Euro 2016 to be held in France.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro/qualifiers/news/newsid=2025048.html|title=Deschamps to lead France at UEFA EURO 2016|publisher=UEFA|date=20 November 2013}}</ref>

For the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], Deschamps "was careful in selecting his 23-man roster for Russia, selecting only players who he felt could gel as a cohesive unit", resulting in the omission of [[Real Madrid]]’s [[Karim Benzema]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/world-cup-daily-now-belgiums-win-lose/ |title=World Cup Daily: It's now Belgium's to win or lose |publisher=Sportsnet |author1=John Molinaro |date=6 July 2018 |access-date=16 July 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Charles |first1=Andy |title=Alexandre Lacazette and Anthony Martial on standby for France World Cup squad and Dimitri Payet out |url=https://www.skysports.com/amp/football/news/12025/11376691/alexandre-lacazette-and-anthony-martial-on-standby-for-france-world-cup-squad-and-dimitri-payet-out |access-date=15 July 2018 |work=Sky Sports |date=21 May 2018}}</ref> Although initially criticized for conservative tactics as the national team had indifferent showings to advance from the group stage with narrow wins over [[Australia national soccer team|Australia]] and [[Peru national football team|Peru]] and a draw against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]],<ref name="worthy-world-cup-winners">{{cite web |url=http://www.skysports.com/transfer/news/11096/11438282/france-are-worthy-world-cup-winners-after-seeing-off-croatia |title=France are worthy World Cup winners after seeing off Croatia |publisher=Sky Sports |author1=Nick Wright |date=16 July 2018 |access-date=16 July 2018 }}</ref> they put in dominant performances during the knockout rounds, defeating [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] 4–3 in the round of 16,<ref>{{cite news |title=France 4 – 3 Argentina |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44439354 |agency=BBC |date=1 July 2018}}</ref> and [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] 2–0 in the quarter-finals to reach the semi-finals.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Bevan |first1=Chris |title=Uruguay 0 France 2 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44652179 |publisher=BBC Sport |access-date=6 July 2018 |location=Nizhny Novgorod |date=6 July 2018}}</ref> During the tournament, Deschamps also deployed Blaise Matuidi – normally a holding midfielder – out of position, playing him out wide, rather than in the centre, as a left-sided [[Midfielder#Winger|winger]] or [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]] in a 4–2–3–1 formation. In this system, Matuidi proved to be equally effective, in spite of his unorthodox playing role, as he was able to track back and limit the attacking threat of the opposing full-backs on the flank. Moreover, he also often tucked into the centre, in order to help support [[Paul Pogba]] and [[N'Golo Kanté]] defensively, which also helped minimise the amount of space given to the main playmakers of France's opponents throughout the tournament, and ultimately helped to nullify their impact on the game in midfield. Furthermore, Matuidi's more defensive role on the left flank provided balance within the team, as it in turn gave [[Kylian Mbappé]] the licence to attack and run at defences from the right wing.<ref name="platform">{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/world-cup-2018-france-vs-argentina-blaise-matuidi-kylian-mbappe-lionel-messi-a8426281.html |title=World Cup 2018: How Blaise Matuidi laid the platform for Kylian Mbappe to put in the performance of the tournament |work=The Independent |author1=Michael Cox |date=2 July 2018 |access-date=11 July 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/world-cup-2018-france-vs-belgium-analysis-nacer-chadli-exposed-defence-attack-tactics-a8441666.html |title=World Cup 2018: How France exposed Nacer Chadli and turned defence into attack to nullify Belgium's flair |work=The Independent |author1=Michael Cox |date=11 July 2018 |access-date=11 July 2018 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.squawka.com/en/news/blaise-matudi-starts-left-wing-as-didier-deschamps-names-odd-side-to-face-peru/1043089#W71VxybS5jwFfELX.97 |title=Blaise Matudi starts left-wing as Didier Deschamps names odd side to face Peru |publisher=www.squawka.com |author1=Steve Jennings |date=21 June 2018 |access-date=11 July 2018 }}</ref> Following these matches, France became World Cup winners after beating Belgium 1–0 in the semi-final<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44692297 |title=France 1-0 Belgium |publisher=BBC Sport |author1=Shamoon Hafez |date=10 June 2018 |access-date=10 June 2018 }}</ref> and Croatia 4–2 in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup Final|final]].<ref name="McNulty1">{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/44754965|title=France 4–2 Croatia|publisher=BBC |date=15 July 2018|access-date=15 July 2018|last=McNulty|first=Phil}}</ref> As such, Deschamps became only the third man after Mário Zagallo and Franz Beckenbauer to win the World Cup as both a player and a manager, and only the second captain after Beckenbauer to do so.<ref name="World Cup as a manager and player"/>
