Alex Sandro completed the season with 43 appearances across competitions, 11 more than the previous year. That made him one of the most frequently used players by coach [[Massimiliano Allegri]]. From a statistical standpoint, the Brazilian also further improved his goalscoring output, netting three times in the league as Juventus completed a third successive league and cup double.

The one trophy that evaded Alex Sandro was the [[UEFA Champions League]], which saw his side lose 4–1 in the [[2017 UEFA Champions League Final|final]] to holders [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]]. Alex Sandro played a key role in Mario Mandžukić's temporary equaliser in the first half, supplying the cross that was chested down to the Croatian by [[Gonzalo Higuaín]]. In the second half, however, Alex Sandro's and his teammates' performances were less convincing, and one of Alex Sandro's mistakes led to a goal from his former Brazil Under-20 and Porto colleague [[Casemiro]].<ref name="Guardian">{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2017/jun/03/juventus-real-madrid-champions-league-final-match-report |title=Real Madrid and Cristiano Ronaldo see off Juventus to win Champions League |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=3 June 2017 |access-date=3 June 2017}}</ref>
