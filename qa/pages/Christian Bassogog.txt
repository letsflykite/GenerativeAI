On 29 September 2015, Bassogog got his debut for his new club AaB in the [[Danish Cup]] against the [[Aarhus]]-located team Lystrup IF. He came on the pitch in the second half with a half hour left.

On 11 February 2016, in the [[Danish Superliga]] winter break, Bassogog was chosen to play the forward-position in a friendly match against [[FC Sioni Bolnisi|Sioni Bolnisi]] from [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. He scored two goals in the match, and former head coach [[Lars Søndergaard]] talked afterwards about, that Bassogog in the future could be used on the forward-position instead of the wing.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.aabtv.dk/aab-fk-sioni-11-februar-2016 |title=AaB-FK Sioni 11.

Following a string of impressive performances for [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] at the [[2017 Africa Cup of Nations]], AaB sporting director [[Allan Gaarde]] commented that Bassogog was the subject of multiple queries regarding potential moves away from AaB in the 2017 January transfer window.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.bt.dk/fodbold/aab-profil-er-brandvarm-der-er-mange-klubber-der-gerne-vil-koebe-ham|title=AaB-profil er brandvarm: 'Der er mange klubber der gerne vil købe ham'|website=Bt.dk|access-date=6 April 2018|language=da}}</ref>

On 19 February 2017, AaB officially announced the departure of Bassogog for a reported fee of 45 million Danish kroner (approx. £5 million) to join the Chinese side [[Henan Jianye F.C.|Henan Jianye FC]].
