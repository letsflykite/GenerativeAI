{{main article|2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup bids}}

The '''Japan 2022 FIFA World Cup bid''' was the second official bid from the [[Japan Football Association]] or the JFA. Had this bid been successful (the bid was won by Qatar), Japan would have been hosting their second World Cup Finals and it would have been their first solo hosting since they shared the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]] with other co-host [[Korea Football Association|South Korea]], becoming the sixth nation to host the tournament twice, after Italy, France, Mexico, Brazil and (West) Germany. On May 4, 2010, the Japanese Football Association Bid team decided to concentrate solely on winning the right to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.<ref>{{cite news |title= Japan drops bid to host 2018 World Cup to aim for 2022 |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/8659185.stm |publisher= BBC Sport |date=2010-05-03| accessdate=2010-05-06}}</ref>

==3D and holographic simulcasts==
Japan pledged that if it had been granted the rights to host the 2022 World Cup games, it would develop technology enabling it to provide a live international telecast of the event in [[3D television|3D]], which would allow 400 stadiums in 208 countries to provide 360 million people with real-time 3D coverage of the games projected on giant screens, captured in 360 degrees by 200 HD cameras. Furthermore, Japan will broadcast the games in holographic format if the technology to do so is available by that time.  Beyond allowing the world's spectators to view the games on flat screens projecting 3D imaging, holographic projection would project the games onto stadium fields, creating a greater illusion of actually being in the presence of the players.<ref name="PS">[http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2010-05/world-cup-bid-japan-offers-project-live-3-d-holographic-games-pitches-worldwide Popular Science: "In 2022 World Cup Bid, Japan Offers to Broadcast Live, Full-Scale 3-D Holographic Games on Fields Worldwide"]</ref>  Microphones embedded below the playing surface would record all sounds, such as ball kicks, in order to add to the sense of realism.<ref name="AFP">[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gNVZsxBSbgXx268O16flQfqXOs_w Agence France-Presse: "Japan offers global 3-D telecasts in 2022 WC bid"]</ref><ref name="engadget">[https://www.engadget.com/2010/05/20/japan-proposes-holographic-3d-broadcasts-for-2022-world-cup/ Engadget: "Japan proposes holographic 3D broadcasts for 2022 World Cup"]</ref>

Japan's bidding team has enlisted pioneering technology scientist [[Jun Murai]] of [[Keio University]] in their plans to host the games.  The country demonstrated holographic display technology at the 2009 [[NAB Show]] using integral cameras (sometimes referred to as [[8K Video Format|8K]]) and [[wavefront reconstruction]],<ref name="TVB">[http://www.televisionbroadcast.com/article/100984 Television Broadcasts Limited: "Japan Pledges 3D Holography for 2022 World Cup"]</ref> and Murai has stated that Japan could develop the means for the necessary technologies to be realized by 2016.  Murai and committee managing director Takato Maruyama have stated they are confident that the endeavor is feasible.<ref name="JT">[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/sw20100518a1.html Japan Times: "Technology fuels Japan's 2022 bid"]</ref>  The event would be co-organized with South Korea.<ref name="TVB"/>

In addition to projection, "translation earpieces" would be available to allow fans of different nations to converse with each other. Devices would also be available which would allow people to instantly capture information about players by pointing at them.<ref name="JT"/>

==Power sources==
The events would be powered in part by attendees, via equipment that would harvest energy created by their footsteps. It would also obtain energy from solar panels.<ref name="PS"/><ref name="engadget"/>

==Industry ramifications==
If Japan had been awarded the 2022 World Cup, providing it with the initiative to realize the proposed technologies, it could drive private companies to develop them as well, in order to stay in competition in the industry, resulting in accelerated development of the medium.<ref name="PS"/> Maruyama expressed his belief that with the advent of such technologies, public viewings at stadiums would increase attendance there by several ten-fold.<ref name="AFP"/>
