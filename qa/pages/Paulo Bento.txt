'''Paulo Jorge Gomes Bento''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈpawlu ˈbẽtu}}; born 20 June 1969) is a Portuguese [[Association football|football]] [[Manager (association football)|manager]] and former player who is currently the manager of the [[United Arab Emirates national football team]].

He represented the [[Portugal national football team|Portugal national team]] in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]].

Bento took up a coaching career in 2005, managing [[Sporting CP]] for four years and four months, with relative success, and won a [[Super League Greece]] title with [[Olympiacos F.C.|Olympiacos]]. He managed the national teams of his country and [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] for four years apiece, taking each team to a World Cup and continental tournament.

==Playing career==
Born in [[Lisbon]], Bento played professionally in his homeland for [[C.F. Estrela da Amadora]], [[Vitória S.C.|Vitória de Guimarães]] and [[S.L. Benfica]], and had a four-year abroad spell with [[Real Oviedo]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lne.es/deportes/2010/11/18/familia-ovetense-paulo-bento/995998.html|title=La familia ovetense de Paulo Bento|trans-title=Paulo Bento's family from Oviedo|newspaper=[[La Nueva España]]|first=Antonio|last=Lorca|language=es|date=18 November 2010|access-date=23 June 2017}}</ref> helping the Spanish club always retain its [[La Liga]] status before moving to [[Sporting CP]], where he finished his career as a player.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/portugal/770055.stm|title=Bento to join Sporting Lisbon|publisher=BBC Sport|date=30 May 2000|access-date=24 September 2009}}</ref> With the latter, he was part of the star-studded team that achieved [[Double (association football)|the double]] in [[2001–02 Primeira Liga|2002]] under the direction of [[Laszlo Bölöni]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.record.pt/futebol/futebol-nacional/liga-nos/sporting/detalhe/blni-mexe-na-equipa-e-aposta-em-rui-bento.html|title=Bölöni mexe na equipa e aposta em Rui Bento|trans-title=Bölöni moves pieces and bets on Rui Bento|newspaper=[[Record (newspaper)|Record]]|language=pt|date=8 March 2002|access-date=23 June 2017}}</ref> contributing 31 games and one goal in the [[Primeira Liga]] and playing alongside [[Mário Jardel]] and [[João Vieira Pinto]] among others.<ref name=PL>{{cite news|url=https://www.dn.pt/desportos/a-ultima-vez-que-o-sporting-foi-campeao-foi-ha-18-anos-12125810.html|title=A última vez que o Sporting foi campeão foi há 18 anos|trans-title=Sporting were champions for the last time 18 years ago|newspaper=[[Diário de Notícias]]|first=Isaura|last=Almeida|language=pt|date=28 April 2020|access-date=22 September 2021}}</ref>

He also played at [[UEFA Euro 2000]] where, along with teammates [[Abel Xavier]] – who played with him at Oviedo for two seasons – and [[Nuno Gomes]], he was suspended (in Bento's case for five months) due to bad behaviour, during the semi-final defeat against [[France national football team|France]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/euro2000/teams/portugal/815848.stm|title=Uefa suspends Portuguese trio|publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 July 2000|access-date=24 September 2009}}</ref>

==Coaching career==
===Sporting CP===
After an emotional 2004 retirement, aged 35, Bento got the job of Sporting's youth team coach. He won the junior championship in 2005, and developed a base to the future. After the sacking of [[José Peseiro]] midway through [[2005–06 Primeira Liga|2005–06 season]], he was promoted to first-team duties in spite of being relatively inexperienced.<ref name=SportingIn>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=357080.html|title=Paulo Bento handed Sporting chance|publisher=UEFA|date=21 October 2005|access-date=12 February 2013}}</ref>

Despite a slow start, Bento managed an impressive turnaround of Sporting's fortunes in the second half of the campaign, as a series of ten consecutive wins placed them within distance of leaders and eventual league champions [[FC Porto]], as the former went on to rank second in that and [[2006–07 Primeira Liga|the following seasons]], achieving direct [[2007–08 UEFA Champions League|qualification]] to the [[UEFA Champions League]].<ref name=PERCENTAGE>{{cite news|url=https://expresso.pt/desporto/paulo-bento-com-saldo-de-617-de-vitorias-no-sporting=f542231|title=Paulo Bento com saldo de 61,7% de vitórias no Sporting|trans-title=Paulo Bento with a 61,7% win at Sporting|newspaper=[[Expresso (newspaper)|Expresso]]|language=pt|date=20 October 2009|access-date=22 September 2021}}</ref> He was responsible for bringing youth products [[Nani (footballer)|Nani]], [[João Moutinho]] and [[Miguel Veloso]] into the spotlight.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.dn.pt/arquivo/2006/jogadores-formados-em-alvalade-empeso-no-plantel-da-equipa-principal-644038.html|title=Jogadores formados em Alvalade em 'peso' no plantel da equipa principal|trans-title=Players developed at Alvalade the 'bulk' of main squad|newspaper=Diário de Notícias|first=Tiago|last=Silva Pires|language=pt|date=31 July 2006|access-date=22 September 2021}}</ref>

Bento signed a new two-year contract in June 2007.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/memberassociations/news/newsid=550160.html|title=Bento refreshes Sporting ties|publisher=UEFA|date=12 June 2007|access-date=25 May 2010}}</ref> His side had a turbulent pre-season in preparation for [[2007–08 Primeira Liga|2007–08]], with defense mainstays [[Rodrigo Tello]] and [[Marco Caneira]] leaving the club while Portuguese international goalkeeper [[Ricardo (footballer, born 1976)|Ricardo]] was sold to [[Real Betis]]. With little resources to invest, the club brought [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] promises – [[Marat Izmailov]], [[Vladimir Stojković]] and [[Simon Vukčević]] – aboard.

After a very irregular season, Bento managed to lead the team to an unprecedented third consecutive [[2008–09 UEFA Champions League|qualification for the Champions League]], with another second-place finish in spite of spending most of the year below third, pipping Guimarães and Benfica in the final matchday. He also [[2007–08 Taça de Portugal|retained]] the [[Taça de Portugal]], beating Porto in the final (2–0 after [[Overtime (sports)|extra time]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://maisfutebol.iol.pt/taca-sporting-f-c-porto-2-0-a-p-cronica|title=Taça: Sporting-F.C.

Bento's team broke a number of long-standing club records, including the first season without home defeats since 1987, the first capture of back-to-back Portuguese cups since 1974 and the first time since 1962 that Sporting finished three consecutive campaigns in the top two league positions. At the age of 38, he also became only the sixth manager in the history of Portuguese football to win back-to-back Portuguese cups, alongside the likes of [[János Biri]], [[John Mortimore (footballer)|John Mortimore]] or [[José Maria Pedroto]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://maisfutebol.iol.pt/taca-de-portugal-bento-pode-ser-o-6-a-ganhar-duas-vezes-consecutivas|title=Taça de Portugal: Bento pode ser o 6º a ganhar duas vezes consecutivas|trans-title=Portuguese Cup: Bento may be 6th to win two in a row|publisher=Mais Futebol|language=pt|date=16 May 2008|access-date=22 September 2021}}</ref>

On 15 July 2008, [[The Sun (United Kingdom)|''The Sun'']] and ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] were planning to hire Bento (reportedly [[Cristiano Ronaldo]]'s friend and former teammate) as manager [[Alex Ferguson]]'s new assistant after the departure of previous number two [[Carlos Queiroz]] to manage the Portugal national team.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/manutd/2390964/Manchester-United-turn-to-Cristiano-Ronaldo-friend-in-search-for-new-assistant.html|title=Manchester United turn to Cristiano Ronaldo friend in search for new assistant|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|first=Matt|last=Lawless|date=15 July 2008|access-date=18 August 2008|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723062401/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/leagues/premierleague/manutd/2390964/Manchester-United-turn-to-Cristiano-Ronaldo-friend-in-search-for-new-assistant.html|archive-date=23 July 2008}}</ref> He quickly denied any speculation, and reaffirmed his intention to stay put.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.skysports.com/story/0,19528,11661_3823049,00.html|title=Bento rejects Red Devils talk|publisher=[[Sky Sports]]|date=15 July 2008|access-date=18 August 2008}}</ref>

Already the second-most successful coach in the history of the club in terms of trophies won, only surpassed by [[József Szabó (footballer, born 1896)|József Szabó]], Bento gained the nickname "Cup-Eater" as a consequence of the four pieces of silverware added to the [[Estádio José Alvalade]] cabinet under his command.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://diario.iol.pt/desporto/sporting-paulo-bento-supertaca-fc-porto/982048-4062.html|title=Paulo Bento aceita a alcunha "papa-taças": "É bom sinal"|trans-title=Bento accepts "cup-eater" nickname: "It's a good sign"|publisher=Diário IOL|language=pt|date=16 August 2008|access-date=16 August 2008}}</ref> He led his team to a [[2008–09 UEFA Champions League|1–0 home defeat]] of [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk]] on 4 November 2008, therefore mathematically securing automatic qualification for the knockout stages of the Champions League for the first time in their history; in the process, they also broke the club's record number of points in [[UEFA]]'s main competition (nine) and remarkably did so with two matches to spare, becoming the first team to qualify from the group phase (alongside [[FC Barcelona]], from the same group).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2009/matches/round=15276/match=302749/postmatch/report/index.html|title=Derlei sparks Sporting celebrations|publisher=UEFA|first=Andy|last=Brassell|date=4 November 2008|access-date=12 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/01d3-0e704351f935-c80424ea536f-1000--bento-basks-in-sporting-success/?iv=true|title=Bento basks in Sporting success|publisher=UEFA|date=4 November 2008|access-date=22 September 2021}}</ref>
