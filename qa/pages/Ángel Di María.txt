Di María began his career with [[Rosario Central]] but came into prominence at Benfica after signing for the club in 2007, aged 19. He helped Benfica win the [[Primeira Liga]], the club's first league title in five years, and two [[Taça da Liga]] titles. In 2010, Di María moved to Spanish club [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]] in a transfer worth €25&nbsp;million, where he won a [[2011–12 La Liga]] title and the [[2013–14 UEFA Champions League]].  He subsequently signed for [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in 2014 in a then-British record deal worth £59.7&nbsp;million (€75.6&nbsp;million), but left a year later to join [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]]. During his time in England, Di María was selected in the [[FIFPRO#FIFA FIFPRO Men's World 11|FIFPRO Men's World 11]] in 2014.<ref>{{Cite news |title= FIFPro World XI: Which 11 players made FIFA's team of the year for 2014? |date= 13 January 2015 |url= https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11096/9643492/fifpro-world-xi-which-11-players-made-fifas-team-of-the-year-for-2014}}</ref> In France, Di María won five league titles, five [[Coupe de France]] and four [[Coupe de la Ligue]], which includes three domestic [[List of association football teams to have won four or more trophies in one season|quadruples]], and helped the club reach its [[2020 UEFA Champions League Final|first Champions League final]] in 2020. He is also the club's [[List of Paris Saint-Germain F.C. records and statistics#All-time top scorers|ninth-highest goalscorer]] and [[List of Paris Saint-Germain F.C. records and statistics#Assists|all-time leader in assists]]. He joined Italian side [[Juventus FC|Juventus]] for free in the summer of 2022, before returning to Benfica in 2023.

Di María debuted for Argentina internationally in 2007, playing for the [[Argentina national under-20 football team|Argentina under-20 team]]; with the team, he won the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]], held in Canada. Playing for the [[Argentina national under-23 football team|country's Olympic team]] at the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Olympic Games]], Di María scored the winning goal against [[Nigeria national under-23 football team|Nigeria]] in [[Football at the 2008 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|the final]] to win Argentina their second successive [[Olympic medal|Olympic gold medals]] in football. He made his senior debut for Argentina the same year, in 2008, at the age of 20, and has since earned over 130 caps, including appearing in nine major tournaments; he has featured in four [[FIFA World Cup]]s for Argentina; helping his country reach [[2014 FIFA World Cup final|the final]] in [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]] and win their third World Cup in [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022]], the first in 36 years, scoring the second goal in [[2022 FIFA World Cup final|the final]]. Furthermore, Di María has also been part of the Argentina squads that have reached three different [[Copa América finals]], in [[2015 Copa América|2015]], [[Copa América Centenario|2016]] and [[2021 Copa América|2021]], winning the last one, with him netting the only goal in [[2021 Copa América Final|the final]] to win Argentina their first trophy in 28 years.

== Early life ==
Di María was born on 14 February 1988 in [[Rosario, Santa Fe]], as one of three children of Miguel di María and Diana Hernandez, and grew up in Perdriel. As an infant, he was unusually active, and on recommendation of a doctor was signed up for football at age three. He also helped his parents with their work at a local coal yard along with his two sisters, Vanesa and Evelyn. Due to the low income his family earned, purchasing football boots and keeping up with Di María's hobby was difficult for his parents. He considers himself to be a "family man" and has used a significant amount of his salary to "give back" to his family.<ref name=footballs>{{cite news |title=Angel Di Maria to Manchester United: Winger was once sold for 35 footballs – now it's £60m |first=Paul|last=Smith|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/angel-di-maria-to-manchester-united-the-winger-once-sold-for-35-footballs--now-its-60m-9690032.html |date=25 August 2014|newspaper=The Independent|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140924045010/http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/transfers/angel-di-maria-to-manchester-united-the-winger-once-sold-for-35-footballs--now-its-60m-9690032.html|archive-date=24 September 2014}}</ref> After being transferred to [[S.L.

==== 2011–12: La Liga win ====
During the start of the [[2011–12 La Liga|2011–12 season]], Di María endured a tough series of matches as he struggled to adapt to the pace of the league following the summer break. As a result, Di María's early performance for the season was mixed with moments of genuinely good play interspersed with moments of sheer madness by the Argentine. This point was well illustrated during Real Madrid's 1–0 defeat to Levante, a match which saw a clearly out-of-sorts Di María commit a horror foul on Levante's [[Juanfran (footballer, born 1976)|Juanfran]] during the match. Di María caused the two teams to clash and an on-field incident ensued. However, Di María's performances would improve, including opening up a significant gap at the top of the assists table. From October 2011, Di María was being picked by Madrid head coach [[José Mourinho]] ahead of [[Kaká]] and [[Mesut Özil]], a sign of his improving form.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

On 27 November 2011, Di María played 60 minutes in a league match against city rivals [[Atlético Madrid]], in which he scored a goal for Real Madrid. Mourinho's team won the match 4–1. On 3 December 2011, Di María scored Real's first goal from a sharp angle in a 3–0 defeat of [[Sporting de Gijón]] in La Liga.<ref>{{cite web |title=Real Madrid ease past Sporting Gijon 3–0 |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/real-madrid-ease-past-sporting-gijon-30/208452-5-21.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111206083001/http://ibnlive.in.com/news/real-madrid-ease-past-sporting-gijon-30/208452-5-21.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 December 2011 |publisher=IBN |date=3 December 2011 |access-date=26 August 2014 }}</ref> He was a constant threat and presence in the starting XI as Real Madrid won their 32nd league title, playing in their 3–0 win over [[Athletic Bilbao]] that clinched the league title.<ref>{{cite news |title=Real Madrid win La Liga title with victory over Athletic Bilbao |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17932028 |publisher=BBC Sport (British Broadcasting Corporation) |date=2 May 2012 |access-date=26 August 2014 }}</ref>
