Oliver was appointed to take charge of the final of the [[2015 FIFA U-17 World Cup]]. Oliver was promoted to the [[UEFA]] Elite Group of Referees in 2018.

==Refereeing career==
Born in [[Ashington]], [[Northumberland]], Oliver was introduced to refereeing by his father, Clive, at the age of 14.<ref>[http://www.refworld.com/referee/158/0 Refworld profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715171613/http://refworld.com/referee/158/0 |date=15 July 2011 }}</ref> He quickly progressed through the ranks and was promoted to the National List of Referees in 2007; he refereed the [[2007 Conference National play-off final]], becoming the youngest football referee to officiate at [[Wembley Stadium]]. In addition he had already become the youngest [[English Football League|Football League]] [[Assistant referee (association football)|assistant referee]], youngest Football League referee, and would also become the youngest [[Assistant referee (association football)#Fourth official|fourth official]] in the [[Premier League]].

The Oliver family enjoyed a unique refereeing double when father Clive took charge of the [[2009 Football League Two play-off final|2009 League Two play-off final]] and Michael officiated the next day at the [[2009 Football League One play-off final|2009 League One play-off final]].
Oliver was set to become the youngest referee in the Premier League when he was appointed to a match between [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] in January 2010.<ref>[https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/michael-oliver-set-become-youngest-1409103 Michael Oliver set to become youngest referee] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220708064056/https://www.chroniclelive.co.uk/news/north-east-news/michael-oliver-set-become-youngest-1409103 |date=8 July 2022 }} [[Evening Chronicle]]</ref> However, adverse weather resulted in him having to postpone the match, and an ankle operation later sidelined him until April.<ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/aug/06/michael-oliver-premier-league-select-referee Michael Oliver set to make history] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170108193547/https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/aug/06/michael-oliver-premier-league-select-referee |date=8 January 2017 }} ''The Guardian''</ref> He was promoted to the Select Group in August 2010, his first appointment being [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] versus [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]]. Oliver was 25 years and 182 days old, breaking [[Stuart Attwell]]'s record as the youngest-ever Premier League referee. 

Oliver was appointed fourth official for the [[2013 Football League Cup Final|2013 League Cup final]] at Wembley Stadium. He refereed the FA Cup semi-final between [[Wigan Athletic F.C.|Wigan Athletic]] and [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] in April 2013 and in doing so became the youngest referee to take charge of an FA Cup semi-final. Wigan went on to win the FA Cup and played [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] in the subsequent [[2013 FA Community Shield|FA Community Shield]] match in which Oliver was assigned as fourth official.

He was the referee for the [[2014 FA Community Shield]] between [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] and [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.thefa.com/news/competitions/fa-community-shield/2014/jul/michael-oliver-appointed-shield-referee-010714 | title=Michael Oliver to referee FA Community Shield | publisher=The Football Association | date=1 July 2014 | access-date=22 July 2014 | archive-date=23 July 2014 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140723093314/http://www.thefa.com/news/competitions/fa-community-shield/2014/jul/michael-oliver-appointed-shield-referee-010714 | url-status=live }}</ref> The FA Cup holders Arsenal won the match 3–0.

Oliver refereed three group stage matches in the [[2016–17 UEFA Champions League]], his first being [[Sporting Clube de Portugal|Sporting CP]] against [[Legia Warsaw]] in September 2016.

On 11 April 2018, Oliver refereed the second leg of the [[2017–18 UEFA Champions League]] quarter-final between [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] and [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]]. Real Madrid won the first leg 3–0 in [[Turin]], which meant Juventus would have to win 3–0 in [[Madrid]] to take the match to [[overtime (sports)|extra time]]. Juventus led 3–0 until the 93rd minute, when Oliver awarded an injury time penalty to Real Madrid after [[Medhi Benatia]] challenged [[Lucas Vázquez]] in the box. Juventus players swarmed Oliver, with veteran goalkeeper and captain [[Gianluigi Buffon]] at the centre of the confrontation, receiving a red card for verbal abuse. Oliver also issued nine yellow cards during the match. Second goalkeeper [[Wojciech Szczęsny]] was forced to be substituted in, with the resulting penalty kick converted by [[Cristiano Ronaldo]] in the 98th minute, for a final 4–3 aggregate win for Real Madrid to advance to the semi-final.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.football-italia.net/119791/cl-juve-heartbreak-bernabeu|title=CL: Juve heartbreak at the Bernabeu|publisher=Football Italia|date=11 April 2018|access-date=15 April 2018|archive-date=26 January 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210126235653/https://www.football-italia.net/119791/cl-juve-heartbreak-bernabeu|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Burton|first1=Chris|title=Benatia 'disgusted by the world of football' after controversial penalty call crushes Juventus' dreams|url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/benatia-disgusted-by-the-world-of-football-after/qhwd54p9l8w51m7fvm453fz83|access-date=12 April 2018|publisher=Goal.com|date=12 April 2018|archive-date=13 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180413043248/http://www.goal.com/en/news/benatia-disgusted-by-the-world-of-football-after/qhwd54p9l8w51m7fvm453fz83|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thescore.com/liga/news/1525639-buffon-referee-has-a-trash-can-where-his-heart-should-be|title=Buffon: Referee 'has a trashcan in place of a heart'|publisher=thescore.com|date=11 April 2018|access-date=15 April 2018|archive-date=22 April 2021|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20210422162315/https://www.thescore.com/liga/news/1525639-buffon-referee-has-a-trash-can-where-his-heart-should-be|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2018/matches/round=2000883/match=2021703/index.html#/|title=MATCH SUMMARY|publisher=UEFA|date=11 April 2018|access-date=15 April 2018|archive-date=14 April 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180414045453/http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2018/matches/round=2000883/match=2021703/index.html#/|url-status=live}}</ref>

Several days later the [[UK Police|police]] investigated threatening text messages sent to Oliver's wife, Lucy, who had her mobile number posted on social media after the game, which led to the abusive texts.
