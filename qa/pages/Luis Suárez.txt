'''Luis Alberto Suárez Díaz''' ({{IPA-es|ˈlwis ˈswaɾes}}; born 24 January 1987) is a Uruguayan professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Striker (association football)|striker]] for [[Campeonato Brasileiro Série A]] club [[Grêmio Foot-Ball Porto Alegrense|Grêmio]] and the [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay national team]]. Nicknamed ''El Pistolero'' ('The Gunman'), known for his finishing inside and outside the box and his vision, Suárez is regarded as one of the greatest strikers of all time.<ref>{{cite web |date=24 September 2020 |title=Adiós, pistolero |url=https://www.elperiodico.com/es/barca/20200922/adios-pistolero-luis-suarez-marcha-fc-barcelona-atletico-8122164 |website=El Periódico |language=es}}</ref> <!-- Do not modify the contents of this line, without first reaching consensus on the player's talk page. -->Suárez has won two [[European Golden Shoe]]s, an [[Eredivisie#Top scorers|Eredivisie Golden Boot]], a [[Premier League Golden Boot]], and a [[Pichichi Trophy]].

Suárez began his senior club career at Nacional in 2005. At age 19, he signed for [[FC Groningen|Groningen]], before transferring to [[AFC Ajax|Ajax]] in 2007. There, he won the [[2009–10 KNVB Cup|KNVB Cup]] and the [[2010–11 Eredivisie|Eredivisie]]. In 2011, Suárez signed for [[Premier League]] club [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]], and won the [[2011–12 Football League Cup|League Cup]] in his first full season. Having established a strike partnership with [[Daniel Sturridge]], he equalled the goalscoring record for a 38-game Premier League season and won his first European Golden Shoe in 2014. That summer, Suárez moved to [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in a transfer worth £64.98 million (€82.3 million), making him one of the [[List of most expensive association football transfers|most expensive players]] of all time.

Dubbed ''MSN'', Suárez was part of a dominant trio alongside [[Lionel Messi]] and [[Neymar]], winning the [[Treble (association football)|treble]] of [[La Liga]], the [[Copa del Rey]] and the [[UEFA Champions League]] in his first season. In his second season, he won the [[Pichichi Trophy]] and his second European Golden Shoe, becoming the first player since 2009 to win both awards other than Messi or [[Cristiano Ronaldo]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2016/05/16/luis-suarez-gana-su-segunda-bota-de-oro/ |title= Luis Suárez gana su segunda Bota de Oro|date=16 May 2016 |access-date=16 May 2016 |publisher=[[CNN]]|language=es}}</ref> He also led La Liga in assists, becoming the first player to do so in both goals and assists in league history.<ref name="Goal.com">{{cite news|last=Crawford|first=Stephen|date=14 May 2016|title=Luis Suarez: Barca's highest-scoring Uruguayan tops goals AND assist charts|website=Goal.com|url=http://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/3908/main/2016/05/14/23520352/luis-suarez-barcas-highest-scoring-uruguayan-tops-goals-and?}}</ref><ref name="Luis Suarez Player Profile">{{cite news|url=http://www.espnfc.us/player/125088/luis-suarez/|title=Luis Suarez Player Profile|date=14 May 2016|work=ESPN}}</ref> With Barcelona, Suárez won ten additional trophies, including three La Liga titles and three [[Copa del Rey|Copas del Rey]].

Suárez was found by a group of scouts from the Dutch club [[FC Groningen|Groningen]] when they were in Uruguay to scout another player. As they watched, he won and converted a penalty and scored a "wonder goal" against [[Defensor Sporting|Defensor]]. After watching only that match, the scouts approached Suárez and said they wanted to buy him, and after the season, Groningen paid Nacional €800,000 for him.<ref name="Pearce 1-2"/> Suárez was thrilled to go to Europe because his then girlfriend, and now wife, Sofía Balbi, had moved to [[Barcelona]]; they had maintained a long-distance relationship for a year and he wanted to move closer to her.<ref name="ESPNportrait"/><ref name="personal bio"/>

Two days later, on 26 June, the [[FIFA Disciplinary Code|FIFA Disciplinary Committee]], banned Suárez for nine international matches, effective immediately, meaning he would take no further part in the World Cup. The ban ruled him out of [[2015 Copa América]] as well.

Suárez, who is married to an Italian citizen, was eligible to take a [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages|B1 Italian Language exam]] and flew to [[Perugia]] in September 2020 to take the test and gain Italian citizenship. Though obtaining the results of the language exam and approval of citizenship takes several months and several years respectively to be processed, Suárez reportedly got his language exam results within hours and would have his citizenship approved in several weeks. The Italian media had noted that this led to accusations of special treatment against Suárez, especially as Italian laws had been changed in 2018 to make obtaining citizenship by marriage more difficult.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.thelocal.it/20200921/anger-in-italy-over-fast-tracked-vip-citizenship-process-for-suarez |title=Anger in Italy over 'fast-tracked' citizenship process for Suárez |newspaper=The Local Italy |date=21 September 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220605055133/https://www.thelocal.it/20200921/anger-in-italy-over-fast-tracked-vip-citizenship-process-for-suarez/|archive-date=5 June 2022}}</ref> In September 2020, an investigation was launched over accusations that he had cheated his way into gaining Italian citizenship.<ref name="Investigation"/>
