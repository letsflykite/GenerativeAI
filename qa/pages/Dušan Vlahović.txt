== Style of play ==
Vlahović is a complete [[Striker (association football)|striker]], known for his physicality, technique and eye for goal.<ref name=":0" /> He excels at picking up the ball in central areas or the inside right or left channels and maintaining possession.<ref name=":style of play1">{{Cite web|date=7 January 2022|title=Dusan Vlahovic: A Scouting Report on the world's next elite striking talent|url=https://gunnerstown.com/arsenal/2022/01/07/dusan-vlahovic-a-scouting-report-on-the-worlds-next-elite-striking-talent/|access-date=24 May 2022|website=gunnerstown.com|language=en}}</ref> He has multiple facets to his hold up and link play. His best assets are his strength to hold up the ball, and then his ability to turn and dribble past the first defender.<ref name=":style of play1" /> When playing for [[ACF Fiorentina|Fiorentina]], he often received the ball under pressure from either a long ball or linking with his midfielders.<ref name=":style of play1" />

Vlahović is a very efficient ball carrier, and his primary way to retain possession and circulate the ball is to use his strength in the contact and to use his superior dribbling ability to evade his marker. He is able to draw in opposition defenders and create space for his teammates or for himself with dribbling.<ref name=":style of play1" /> Vlahović is a potent and clinical penalty box presence, a devastating finisher in the [[penalty area]], as he is able to hold his position in order to pin the opposition back into their box, before swiftly making a movement into the channels as his team look to locate areas within the final third.<ref name=":style of play2">{{Cite web|date=3 April 2021|title=Dušan Vlahović – Scout Report|url=https://betweenthelines5638.wordpress.com/2021/04/03/dusan-vlahovic-scout-report/|access-date=24 May 2022|website=betweenthelines5638.wordpress.com|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|date=28 January 2022|title=VLAHOVIC JOINS JUVENTUS!|url=https://www.juventus.com/en/news/articles/vlahovic-joins-juventus|access-date=28 January 2022|website=Juventus.com|language=en}}</ref> His playing style has led him to be compared to [[Cristiano Ronaldo]], [[Erling Haaland]] and [[Jamie Vardy]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=Why Dusan Vlahovic is perfect for Juventus|url=https://themastermindsite.com/2022/02/27/why-dusan-vlahovic-is-perfect-for-juventus/|access-date=24 May 2022|website=themastermindsite.com|date=27 February 2022 |language=en}}</ref>
