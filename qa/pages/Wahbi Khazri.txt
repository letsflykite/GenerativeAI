'''Wahbi Khazri''' ({{lang-ar|وهبي خزري}}; born 8 February 1991) is a professional [[footballer]] who plays as an [[attacking midfielder]] or as a [[forward (association football)|forward]] for {{French football updater|Montpellier}} club [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]].

Trained at [[SC Bastia|Bastia]] from 2004, Khazri made his professional debut there in 2009 and quickly became a vital part of the team, as he helped the club reach promotion to [[Ligue 2]] in 2011, and then Ligue 1 in 2012. He left in 2014 to join fellow French side [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Bordeaux]]. In 2016, Khazri joined [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] in the [[Premier League]]; he was subsequently loaned to [[Stade Rennais F.C.|Rennes]] during the 2017–18 campaign. After finishing the season with 11 goals in 29 games, Khazri attracted the attention of [[AS Saint-Étienne|Saint-Étienne]], who recruited him in July 2018. In 2022, Khazri signed for Montpellier.

Born in France, Khazri represented his birth country at youth international level, and [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]] at senior international level. He was the former captain of the national team, playing  74 matches and scoring 25 goals for the side between 2013 and 2022. He represented Tunisia at five [[Africa Cup of Nations]] tournaments and at both the [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup]].

On 7 May 2016, Khazri scored a volley in a 3–2 win over Chelsea as manager [[Sam Allardyce]]'s team neared survival in the Premier League. Richard Mennear of the ''[[Sunderland Echo]]'' wrote that "His work rate was immense, pressing and probing the Chelsea defence and causing problems from set pieces. He has regained his form just at the right time".<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mennear |first1=Richard |title=Sunderland 3 Chelsea 2: Wahbi Khazri back to his best plus five other things learned from huge win|work=Sunderland Echo |date=8 May 2016}}</ref>

This achievement allows him to bring his total of goals to ten units, a score he had never achieved before in a single season in the league. His second half of the season was less brilliant but he still ended the [[2018–19 Ligue 1|2018–19 season]] with thirteen goals scored, making him the top scorer for his team in this exercise.{{Citation needed|date=June 2022}}

Khazri had a difficult start to the [[2019–20 Ligue 1|2019–20 season]]. If he is decisive passer for [[Romain Hamouma]] during the victory in Dijon 1–2, it is not until the eleventh day, 27 October against Amiens, to see him score his first goal of the season, not sufficient however to obtain the victory 2–2.

During the [[2021–22 Ligue 1|2021–22 season]], on 30 October, during a trip to face [[FC Metz|Metz]], he scored his seventh goal of the season in Ligue 1 with a shot from 68 meters, the furthest goal in Ligue 1 since 2006, the first year in which the distances of shots were measured.<ref>{{Cite web|date=30 October 2021|title=Le lob record de Khazri affole les compteurs de la LFP|url=https://www.foot-national.com/ligue-1/le-lob-record-de-khazri-affole-les-compteurs-de-la-lfp-703048|access-date=11 November 2021|website=Foot National|language=fr}}</ref> After the eviction of [[Claude Puel]] as manager, interim coach [[Julien Sablé]] entrusted the captain's armband to Khazri.
