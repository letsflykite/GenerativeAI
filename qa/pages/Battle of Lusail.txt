==Background==
The [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] had previously met nine times, [[Argentina–Netherlands football rivalry|developing a rivalry]] with one another; the Dutch won four, while the Argentines won one match, with the other four matches ending in a draw. Five of the matches occurred in the World Cup: a 4–0 win for the Dutch at the [[1974 FIFA World Cup Group A#Netherlands vs Argentina|second group stage]] in 1974 was replied with a 3–1 win for the Argentines in the [[1978 FIFA World Cup Final|1978 final]]. The Dutch won 2–1 in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Netherlands vs Argentina|1998 quarter-finals]] prior to two goalless draws in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Group C#Netherlands v Argentina|2006 group stage]] and at the semi-final stage of the previous major tournament where they both had made an appearance, the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] held in Brazil, which had finished 0–0 after extra-time, with Argentina prevailing 4-2 after penalties.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.fifa.com/tournaments/mens/worldcup/2014brazil/match-center/300186490|title=Match Report |date=10 December 2022 |access-date=11 December 2022|work=FIFA}}</ref> The previous game had been similarly intense and close but had not featured the same level of animosity between the players. [[Lionel Messi]] for Argentina and [[Daley Blind]] for the Netherlands were the only players who took part in [[2014 FIFA World Cup knockout stage#Netherlands vs Argentina|that fixture]] who were also on the field in Lusail, in addition to Netherlands manager [[Louis van Gaal]].

[[Nahuel Molina]] scored for Argentina after 35 minutes, and Lionel Messi doubled the lead via a penalty in the 73rd minute. Substitute [[Wout Weghorst]] then scored two goals before the end of the second half, forcing the match into extra time. Neither team scored in the additional period, so it went to a penalty shoot-out.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/63830319 |title=World Cup 2022: Argentina beat the Netherlands in penalty shootout to reach semi-finals |first=Phil |last=McNulty|author-link= Phil McNulty|date=9 December 2022|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=10 December 2022}}</ref>

===Summary===
====First half====
The first half of the game was relatively balanced, with both sides never having a clear-cut chance for the opening half-hour of the game. Both teams had dominant spells with Argentina coming close to creating a chance several times but being stopped by a disciplined Dutch defense. Walter Samuel, the ''Albiceleste'' assistant manager, was cautioned at around the half-hour mark. Argentina talisman Messi then cut through the Dutch defense with a precise pass to assist Molina for the first goal of the night. The half was relatively incident free but the game started getting more antagonistic onwards from the 43rd minute when the first yellow card was handed to Dutch center-back [[Jurriën Timber]], which was quickly followed by a trio of yellow cards for his team-mate Weghorst, who was on the bench at the time, as well as Argentines [[Cristian Romero (footballer, born 1998)|Cristian Romero]] and [[Marcos Acuña]], who received his second caution of the tournament and was thus rendered unavailable for the semi-finals. The half ended with Argentina in control, and the Dutch failing to create a clear goalscoring opportunity.

====Second half====
The second half was highly dramatic, as the game intensified and the Dutch pressed on for an equaliser. Acuña was brought down at the edge of the box around the 70-minute mark, and the resulting penalty was converted by Messi to hand the Argentines a two-goal lead with only 20 minutes of regulation time remaining. Messi then celebrated in front of Van Gaal and the Dutch bench. The goal was also Messi's tenth goal in a World Cup match, tying [[Gabriel Batistuta]]'s record for most World Cup goals by an Argentine player.<ref name=AlJazeera>{{cite web|last1=Melimopoulos|first1=Elizabeth|last2=Zemelyte|first2=Beatrice|last3=Sharma|first3=Rohan|last4=Brownsell|first4=James|url=https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/liveblog/2022/12/9/live-netherlands-vs-argentina-world-cup-2022|title=Netherlands vs Argentina 3-4 on penalties – as it happened|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]|date=9 December 2022|accessdate=27 December 2022}}</ref> Messi celebrated the goal by cupping his hands around his ears in front of the Dutch bench, considered "a jibe" toward Van Gaal; the gesture was reminiscent of a goal celebration sometimes used by former Argentina player [[Juan Roman Riquelme]], "who reportedly had disagreements with Van Gaal when they were both at [[FC Barcelona|Barcelona]] in the early 2000s."<ref name=Douglas>{{cite web|last=Douglas|first=Steve|url=https://apnews.com/article/world-cup-sports-netherlands-lionel-messi-fc-barcelona-53c4613d5ba5de0e26c5429bbed78104|title=Messi snarls, taunts and thrills in World Cup classic|publisher=[[AP News]]|date=10 December 2022|accessdate=20 December 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Nicolau|first=Jordi|url=https://www.marca.com/en/world-cup/2022/12/10/63946852e2704ea3978b457a.html|title=Messi's controversial gesture in Netherlands vs Argentina: Did he celebrate in Van Gaal's face?|work=[[Marca (newspaper)|Marca]]|date=10 December 2022|accessdate=27 December 2022}}</ref>

The Dutch made substitutions and changed their play style, to capitalize on the height and physical size advantages they had over the Argentine side. Weghorst, who had picked up a yellow card on the bench, was one of these substitutions.<ref name=Burt2022/><ref name=AlJazeera/> As the Dutch players searched for a crucial goal, tempers rapidly flared as [[Memphis Depay]] and [[Lisandro Martínez]] both received yellow cards. Weghorst then scored to make the score 2-1, beating the keeper with a header after a cross by [[Steven Berghuis]]. The Dutch then intensified the search for a vital equalising goal, and tempers flared greatly with several cautions handed out. Berghuis was given a yellow-card as anger increased between the two teams. [[Leandro Paredes]] then fouled [[Nathan Aké]], before booting the dead ball right into the Dutch bench, leading to a major scuffle as the incensed Dutch players closed in on Paredes, who was shoved to the ground by Netherlands captain [[Virgil van Dijk]]. The Argentina bench then came to back their player up with pushing and shoving observed, as Paredes was promptly carded, and the tensions increased to such a degree that even Argentina manager [[Lionel Scaloni]] was cautioned. With the game almost over, Weghorst then scored with the last kick of the game to send the game to extra time.

====Extra time====
After the shock of the last-minute equaliser, the Argentina players immediately went on the attack, trying to reimpose the goal advantage. However, resolute defending by the Netherlands saw the game stay tied. Argentina pressed on, creating several chances, and coming closest to scoring a goal when a shot by [[Enzo Fernández]] hit the goalpost. With the game tied after extra time, the match progressed to a penalty shoot-out.

====Penalty shoot-out====
Netherlands captain Van Dijk took their first penalty. His shot to the left was blocked by an athletic save from Argentina goalkeeper [[Emiliano Martínez]]. Messi then took the first penalty of the shootout for his side, and his second penalty of the night, sending the keeper the wrong way to cooly slot his penalty, giving Argentina an early advantage. Steven Berguis' effort was then saved by Martínez, with Paredes scoring to give Argentina a 2-0 advantage after two turns each. [[Teun Koopmeiners]] then scored the Netherlands' first penalty of the night, reducing the deficit only for it to be restored by [[Gonzalo Montiel]]. Weghorst then scored his penalty to again reduce the arrears for the Dutch, and this time, Fernandez hit the post with his penalty, Argentina's first miss of the shootout. [[Luuk De Jong]] then equalised for the Netherlands, leading to a decisive fifth penalty for Argentina. As Lautaro Martínez started walking from the mid-circle, he was accompanied and harassed by several Dutch players, especially defender [[Denzel Dumfries]], who was given a yellow-card for unsporting behavior. Lautaro then scored to give the Argentines their second consecutive victory over the Dutch in penalty shootouts. Immediately after the winning penalty, several Dutch players responded to the Argentine celebrations by engaging in another physical altercation, where the referee [[Fouls and misconduct (association football)#Red card (dismissal)|sent off]] Dumfries for a second yellow-card.<ref name=FIFA-MatchReport/>
