'''Ederson Santana de Moraes''' (born 17 August 1993), known as '''Ederson''', is a Brazilian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{English football updater|ManchesC}} club [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] and the [[Brazil national football team|Brazil national team]]. He is best known for his skill and control of the ball with his feet and his precise ball distribution abilities. 

Ederson started his career at [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]] in 2008 before joining Portuguese club [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]] one year later, where he would spend two seasons. In 2012, he transferred from [[G.D. Ribeirão|Ribeirão]] to [[Primeira Liga]] club [[Rio Ave F.C.|Rio Ave]] and became a regular starter there. He rejoined Benfica in 2015 and was assigned to the [[S.L. Benfica B|reserves]] before debuting for the first team, with whom he would win four major titles in two seasons. For the 2017–18 season, Ederson joined English club Manchester City for £35 million and became the most expensive goalkeeper of all-time in terms of the nominal value of [[pound sterling]] at the time of his transfer. He went on to win the Premier League and [[EFL Cup]] in [[2017–18 Manchester City F.C. season|his first season]] in England, and won a [[Treble (association football)#Domestic trebles|domestic treble]] the [[2018–19 Manchester City F.C. season|following season]]. In total, Ederson has won five Premier League titles, two [[FA Cup]]s, four EFL Cups and the [[UEFA Champions League]] with City, the latter coming in  [[2022–23 UEFA Champions League|2023]] as part of a [[Treble (association football)#Continental trebles|continental treble]].

Ederson made his senior debut for Brazil in 2017. He was chosen in Brazil's squad for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022]] and the [[Copa América]] in [[2019 Copa América|2019]] and [[2021 Copa América|2021]], winning the 2019 tournament.
