==Controversies==
{{npov|section|date=June 2023}}
On 1 June 2023, it was reported that three days earlier Marciniak spoke at an entrepreneur conference co-organised by [[Sławomir Mentzen]], a right-wing [[libertarian]] politician and leader of the [[Confederation Liberty and Independence]] in Poland, who has in the past been accused of anti-semitic and anti-LGBT statements in his cynical political marketing lecture.<ref>{{cite web |title=Mentzen: piątka Konfederacji to nie są moje poglądy. No to przypominamy |url=https://konkret24.tvn24.pl/polityka/konfederacja-mentzen-piatka-konfederacji-to-nie-sa-moje-poglady-no-to-przypominamy-6877579 |access-date=1 June 2023 |language=pl |date=31 March 2023}}</ref> His attendance at the event was first disclosed by the Polish anti-racist organisation [[Nigdy Więcej|Never Again]]. [[Rafał Pankowski]], the co-founder of Never Again, said: "We are shocked and appalled by Marciniak’s public association with Mentzen and his brand of toxic far-right politics. It is incompatible with the basic values of fair play such as equality and respect. We call upon the referee to acknowledge his mistake. If he does not do it, we believe UEFA and FIFA should draw consequences."<ref>{{Cite news |last=Syal |first=Rajeev |last2= |first2= |date=2023-06-01 |title=Champions League final referee ‘spoke at event with far-right leader’ |language=en-GB |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2023/jun/01/champions-league-final-referee-spoke-at-event-with-far-right-leader |access-date=2023-06-01 |issn=0261-3077}}</ref>

Marciniak responded to Never Again's report by releasing the following statement: "As an international football referee for many years, I always put fair play and respect for other people first and I want to pass these great values onto others. I always distance myself from racism, anti-Semitism and intolerance, as you can see in the games I officiate. I always say 'no to hate' and will propagate that the most important thing is to be a good person."<ref>{{cite web |title=Szymon Marciniak zabrał głos.

The following day, having received further explanation and an apology from Marciniak for participating in the event, UEFA announced he would remain as referee for the UEFA Champions League final scheduled for 10 June.<ref>{{cite web |title=UEFA statement concerning Szymon Marciniak |url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/news/0282-1828af52b2ad-df8e29dfca7b-1000--uefa-statement-concerning-szymon-marciniak/ |publisher=[[UEFA]] |access-date=2 June 2023 |language=en |date=2 June 2023}}</ref>

In response to the report by Never Again, Mentzen released the following statement: "The reason why organizations like Never Again, which I consider trashy, have an impact on reality is because, for some reason, people recognize their right to condemn, label, and exclude others from public debate. I fail to comprehend why anyone would take their opinions and recommendations seriously, as I view them as nothing more than life losers, liars, cheats, and informers. Attempting to introduce the practice of [[cancel culture]] to Poland is highly dangerous, and we must not allow it. The best way to counter this is by disregarding the denunciations from such organizations and discarding them where they belong: in the trash. The alternative we are witnessing now involves forcing people to write falsehoods, engage in [[Self-criticism (Marxism–Leninism)|Soviet-style self-criticism]], and break the spirits of ambitious individuals, ultimately destroying their consciences. These campaigns will never cease. No one can be certain that they will not become the next target of an absurd crusade. Those who aspire to achieve something will be forced to endure being shattered, humiliated, and compelled to submit to leftist ideologies. That is precisely why I vehemently refuse to accept left-wing activists dictating my actions, social interactions, and speech. Such standards should never be allowed to come into effect in Poland."<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nczas.com/2023/06/02/oswiadczenie-mentzena-ws-sytuacji-z-marciniakiem-zmuszanie-ludzi-do-pisania-klamstw-samokrytyk-w-stylu-sowieckim-lamanie-ambitnym-ludziom-kregoslupow/|website=[[Najwyższy Czas!]] | title=Oświadczenie Mentzena ws. z Marciniakiem.
