Kouyaté moved from Senegal to Belgium in 2006, having been offered a youth contract at [[RWDM Brussels FC|RWDM Brussels]]. He played ten games before moving to [[R.S.C. Anderlecht|Anderlecht]] aged 19, where he made 206 appearances and won the [[Belgian First Division A]] four times.

Kouyaté represented the [[Senegal national football team|Senegal national team]] at the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics&nbsp;– Men's tournament|2012 Olympics]]. He played at two [[FIFA World Cup]] and four [[Africa Cup of Nations]] tournaments, including Senegal's victory in [[2021 Africa Cup of Nations|2021]].

==Club career==
===Early career===
Kouyaté began his footballing career in 1996 in his hometown with ASC Yego Dakar and was scouted by [[RWDM Brussels FC|RWDM Brussels]] in September 2006. RWDM Brussels then signed the player in January the following year.<ref>[http://www.rwdm-fcbrussels.be/12-PLAYERS/fiche-fcbrussels-players.html FC BRUSSELS Players] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430152814/http://www.rwdm-fcbrussels.be/12-PLAYERS/fiche-fcbrussels-players.html |date=30 April 2009 }} on www.rwdm-brussels.be</ref> He went on to play ten league appearances for the first team between 2007 and 2008.<ref name="whufc1">{{cite web|url=http://www.whufc.com/articles/cheikhou-kouyate-west-ham_2228487_49276 |title=CHEIKHOU KOUYATE |publisher=West Ham United F.C. |access-date=1 February 2015 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150115021426/http://www.whufc.com/articles/cheikhou-kouyate-west-ham_2228487_49276 |archive-date=15 January 2015 }}</ref>

===Anderlecht===
