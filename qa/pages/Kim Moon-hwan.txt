He was a regular starter for Busan in his first professional season, playing in a number of positions, including winger, wing-back and full-back.

In 2018, under new coach [[Choi Yun-kyum]], Kim played more frequently at left-back and right-back. Despite only making 18 league starts, he was named in the [[K League Best XI|K League 2 Best XI]] at the end of the season. The following year, Kim played almost exclusively at right-back under new coach [[Cho Deok-je]]. He was a regular fixture in the team that achieved promotion to the [[K League 1]], and Kim was named in the league's Best XI for the second season in succession.

Kim signed with [[Los Angeles FC]] on 11 January 2021.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.lafc.com/post/2021/01/11/lafc-signs-korean-international-kim-moon-hwan|title = LAFC Signs Korean International Kim Moon-Hwan &#124; Los Angeles Football Club}}</ref>

==International career==
In 2018, Kim featured for the Korea Under-23 team in both the [[AFC U-23 Championship]] and the [[Asian Games]]. Korea were victorious in the latter, earning Kim and his teammates exemption from military service.

Kim's impressive performances at right-back earned him a full international call-up in September 2018. He made his debut as a substitute in a 2-0 win over [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] on 7 September, and his first start came in the [[AFC Asian Cup]] against [[China national football team|China]] on 16 January 2019.

Kim was named in South Korea's final squad for the [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022 World Cup]] in Qatar. Kim played every minute of Korea's campaign as they progressed from the group stage and exited at the Round of 16.
