The '''2020–21 UEFA Nations League''' was the second season of the [[UEFA Nations League]], an international [[association football]] competition involving the men's national teams of the 55 member associations of [[UEFA]].<ref name="astana">{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=2079556.html |title=UEFA Nations League receives associations' green light |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=27 March 2014}}</ref> The competition was held from September to November 2020 (league phase), October 2021 (Nations League Finals) and March 2022 (relegation play-outs).<ref name="regulations">{{cite web |url=https://documents.uefa.com/v/u/kR6ThiGf9hdVYMlldxMAMw |title=Regulations of the UEFA Nations League, 2020/21 |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |format=PDF |date=13 October 2019 |access-date=13 October 2019 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201116082336/https://documents.uefa.com/internal/api/webapp/documents/jJTWTpzi2KN9D8VRYz~Bpg/content |archive-date=16 November 2020}}</ref>

France won the [[2021 UEFA Nations League final|final]] 2–1 against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] for their first UEFA Nations League title.

==Format==
On 24 September 2019, UEFA announced that a revised format would be used for the 2020–21 edition, the second season of the competition.<ref>{{cite news|date=24 September 2019|title=Format change for 2020/21 UEFA Nations League|website=UEFA.com|publisher=Union of European Football Associations|url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/about-uefa/news/0255-0e99f578e557-a64ea0ed91c9-1000--format-change-for-2020-21-uefa-nations-league/|access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref> The 55 UEFA national teams were divided into four leagues, with Leagues A, B and C featuring sixteen teams each, divided into four groups of four teams. League D featured seven teams divided into two groups, with one containing four teams and the other containing three. The teams were allocated to leagues based on the [[2018–19 UEFA Nations League#Overall ranking|2018–19 UEFA Nations League overall ranking]]. Each team now played six matches within their group, except for one group in League D that played four, using the home-and-away [[round-robin tournament|round-robin]] format on double matchdays in September, October and November 2020. This format ensured that for almost all groups, teams in the same group played their last matches at the same time. It also increased the number of total league phase matches from 138 to 162 and minimised the number of [[Exhibition game#Association football|friendly matches]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefanationsleague/news/0253-0d81b904c47b-54e0462fe9a2-1000/ |title=UEFA Nations League: all you need to know |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=3 March 2020 |access-date=17 June 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=2563561.html |title=What is the UEFA Nations League? |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=24 September 2019 |access-date=24 September 2019}}</ref>

In the top division, League A, teams competed to become the UEFA Nations League champions. The four group winners of League A qualified for the Nations League Finals, which was played in a knockout format consisting of the semi-finals, third place play-off and final. The semi-final pairings were determined by means of an open draw. Host country Italy was selected among the four qualified teams by the UEFA Executive Committee, with the winners of the final crowned as the Nations League champions. The [[video assistant referee]] (VAR) system was used in the Nations League Finals.<ref>{{cite news|date=27 September 2018|title=VAR to be introduced in 2019/20 UEFA Champions League|website=UEFA.com|publisher=Union of European Football Associations|url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/about-uefa/news/0250-0c5119ff28b2-feda7fc5c929-1000--var-to-be-introduced-in-2019-20-uefa-champions-league/|access-date=27 September 2018}}</ref>

Teams also competed for [[promotion and relegation]] to a higher or lower league. The group winners from Leagues B, C and D were promoted, while the last-placed teams of each group in Leagues A and B were relegated. As League C had four groups while League D had only two, the two League C teams that were to be relegated were determined by play-outs in March 2022. Based on the [[#Overall ranking|Nations League overall ranking]] of the fourth-placed teams, the first-ranked team faced the fourth-ranked team and the second-ranked team faced the third-ranked team. Two ties were played over [[two-legged tie|two legs]], with the higher-ranked team hosting the second leg. The team that scored more goals on aggregate over the two legs remained in League C, while the loser was relegated to League D. If the aggregate score was level, [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|extra time]] was played (the [[away goals rule]] was not applied). If still tied after extra time, a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shoot-out]] was used to decide the winner.<ref name="regulations"/> The away goals rule was originally to be used, but was abolished by the UEFA Executive Committee on 16 December 2021.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/mediaservices/mediareleases/news/0270-13f8ddd26eda-315bae3fcfa1-1000/ |title=UEFA Executive Committee approves a new Football Sustainability Strategy 2030 |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=16 December 2021 |access-date=16 December 2021}}</ref>

===Tiebreakers for group ranking===
If two or more teams in the same group were equal on points on completion of the league phase, the following tie-breaking criteria were applied:<ref name="regulations"/>
# Higher number of points obtained in the matches played among the teams in question;
# Superior goal difference in matches played among the teams in question;
# Higher number of goals scored in the matches played among the teams in question;
# Higher number of goals scored away from home in the matches played among the teams in question;
# If, after having applied criteria 1 to 4, teams still had an equal ranking, criteria 1 to 4 were reapplied exclusively to the matches between the teams in question to determine their final rankings.{{efn|When there were two or more teams tied in points, criteria 1 to 4 were applied. After these criteria were applied, they may have defined the position of some of the teams involved, but not all of them. For example, if there was a three-way tie on points, the application of the first four criteria may only have broken the tie for one of the teams, leaving the other two teams still tied. In this case, the tiebreaking procedure was resumed, from the beginning, for those teams that were still tied.}} If this procedure did not lead to a decision, criteria 6 to 10 applied;
# Superior goal difference in all group matches;
# Higher number of goals scored in all group matches;
# Higher number of away goals scored in all group matches;
# Higher number of wins in all group matches;
# Higher number of away wins in all group matches;
# Lower disciplinary points total in all group matches (1 point for a single yellow card, 3 points for a red card as a consequence of two yellow cards, 3 points for a direct red card, 4 points for a yellow card followed by a direct red card).
# Position in the [[#Seeding|2020–21 UEFA Nations League access list]].

===2022 FIFA World Cup qualification===
{{Main|2022 FIFA World Cup qualification (UEFA)|2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA second round}}

The Nations League was partially linked with European qualification for the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] in Qatar, with the format confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee during their meeting in [[Nyon]], Switzerland on 4 December 2019.<ref name="ExCo">{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/mediaservices/mediareleases/newsid=2634046.html |title=UEFA Executive Committee agenda for Nyon meeting |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=27 November 2019 |access-date=28 November 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/news/newsid=2191264.html |title=UEFA Nations League format and schedule approved |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=4 December 2014}}</ref> The qualifying structure depended on results from the Nations League, although to a lesser degree than the [[UEFA Euro 2020 qualifying play-offs]]. The ten group winners after the first round (group stage) qualified directly for the World Cup. Then, the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA second round|second round (play-offs)]] was contested by the ten group runners-up, along with the best two Nations League group winners, based on the [[#Overall ranking|Nations League overall ranking]], that finished outside the top two of their qualifying group.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefanationsleague/news/0258-0e2bb376a99e-1984c4ff291f-1000/ |title=2020/21 UEFA Nations League: All you need to know |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=3 March 2020 |access-date=17 June 2020}}</ref> The play-offs were split into three play-off paths, played in two single-match knockout rounds (semi-finals and finals, with the home teams to be drawn), from which an additional three teams also qualified.<ref name="regulations"/>

===Effects of the COVID-19 pandemic===
Due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Europe]], the UEFA Executive Committee approved on 28 August 2020 the following principles for the league phase of the 2020–21 UEFA Nations League:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/mediaservices/mediareleases/news/0260-1043693afa4e-40877a739cf7-1000/|title=UEFA Executive Committee approves new principles for upcoming national team matches|website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations|date=31 August 2020}}</ref>
*If a team could not field the minimum required number of players (at least 13 players including at least one goalkeeper) due to positive [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2|SARS-CoV-2]] tests and the match could not be rescheduled, the team responsible for the match not taking place were considered to have forfeited the match and lost 0–3.
*If UEFA came to the conclusion that both or none of the teams were responsible for the match not taking place, the outcome of the match was decided by drawing of lots, either home win 1–0, home loss 0–1 or draw 0–0, carried out by the UEFA administration.

On 24 September 2020, UEFA announced that five substitutions would be permitted in Nations League matches during the October and November 2020 international windows. On 31 March 2021, the use of five substitutes was extended to the Nations League Finals in October 2021 and the League C relegation play-outs in March 2022, with these knockout matches permitting a sixth substitution should the match go to extra time.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/mediaservices/mediareleases/news/0267-11edb1571770-3578252ba32d-1000/ |title=Five substitutions allowed at UEFA EURO 2020 and 2021 UEFA Nations League Finals |work=UEFA |date=31 March 2021 |access-date=31 March 2021}}</ref> However, each team was only given three opportunities to make substitutions during matches, excluding substitutions made at half-time, before the start of extra time and at half-time in extra time. During the September 2020 window, only three substitutions had been permitted.<ref name="ExCo 24 September 2020"/>

All matches played in September 2020 were required by UEFA to be held [[Behind closed doors (sport)|behind closed doors]] due to the [[COVID-19 pandemic in Europe]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/mediaservices/mediareleases/news/0260-102b2c2ace44-637fb4a08f89-1000/ |title=UEFA meets general secretaries of member associations |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=19 August 2020 |access-date=1 September 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/mediaservices/mediareleases/news/0260-103712e48c82-4059778ef426-1000/ |title=UEFA Super Cup to test partial return of spectators |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=25 August 2020 |access-date=1 September 2020}}</ref> On 1 October 2020, UEFA announced the partial return of spectators to matches beginning in October 2020, restricted to a maximum of 30 percent of the respective stadium capacity. However, the return of spectators was subject to the decision of local authorities, with regional limits taking precedence over UEFA's maximum allowed capacity. Away supporters were not allowed at the venues. [[Social distancing]] was mandatory for spectators and additional precautionary measures (such as [[Face masks during the COVID-19 pandemic|face masks]]) were implemented in accordance with local regulations.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/insideuefa/mediaservices/mediareleases/news/0262-1081de31d4dc-eb42ed3fe9e8-1000/ |title=UEFA allows return of fans at maximum 30% of capacity pending approval of local authorities |website=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=1 October 2020 |access-date=2 October 2020}}</ref>
