'''Nampalys Mendy''' (born 23 June 1992) is a professional [[association football|footballer]] who last played as a [[defensive midfielder]] for [[EFL Championship]] club [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]]. Born and raised in France, he represents [[Senegal national football team|Senegal]] at international level.

Due to his small stature, simple distribution, and reliable style of play, Mendy has been compared to former [[France national football team|French international]], [[Claude Makélélé]]. Monaco club scout [[Didier Christophe]], for example, referred to Mendy as a "[[carbon copy]]" of Makélélé.<ref name=MendyFuture>{{Cite web |url=http://www.planete-asm.fr/actualite/6196-nampalys-mendy-un-petit-futur-grand.html |title=Nampalys Mendy, un petit futur grand |date=18 September 2010 |publisher=Planete ASM |language=fr |access-date=13 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102200531/http://www.planete-asm.fr/actualite/6196-nampalys-mendy-un-petit-futur-grand.html |archive-date=2 January 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Mendy featured in Senegal's [[2021 Africa Cup of Nations Final]] victory against [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Senegal (Sky Sports)|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/teams/senegal/squad|access-date=6 February 2022|website=Sky Sports}}</ref>

==Club career==
===Early career===
After leaving [[Sporting Toulon Var|Sporting Toulon]] in June 2007, Mendy went on trial with the football section of [[RC Toulonnais|RC Toulon]]. According to Monaco scout [[Didier Christophe]], the Toulon coaches stated that Mendy was there to "make up the numbers". However, while observing Mendy in training, Christophe noticed the player's intelligence and understanding of the game and recommended him to [[Dominique Bijotat]], who was serving as head of the Monaco youth academy.<ref name="MendyFuture" />

===Monaco===
On 27 April 2010, Mendy signed his first professional contract, agreeing to a three-year deal with [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] until June 2013.<ref>{{cite news |title=Premier contrat professionnel pour Nampalys Mendy |url=http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/football/monaco-premier-contrat-professionnel-pour-nampalys-mendy-27-04-2010-901878.php |date=27 April 2010 |work=[[Le Parisien]] |access-date=15 August 2010 |language=fr |archive-date=4 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180704093324/http://www.leparisien.fr/sports/football/monaco-premier-contrat-professionnel-pour-nampalys-mendy-27-04-2010-901878.php |url-status=dead }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Nampalys Mendy passe pro |url=https://www.lequipe.fr/Football/20100427_152012_nampalys-mendy-passe-pro.html |date=27 April 2010 |work=[[L'Equipe]] |access-date=15 August 2010 |language=fr |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823030637/http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/20100427_152012_nampalys-mendy-passe-pro.html |archive-date=23 August 2010 }}</ref> In July 2010, he was called up to the first team by manager [[Guy Lacombe]] for pre-season training, again to make up the numbers with Lacombe missing several players such as [[Diego Pérez (footballer)|Diego Pérez]], [[Nicolas Nkoulou]], [[Park Chu-young]], and [[Lukman Haruna]], who had all participated in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].<ref name="MendyFuture" />
