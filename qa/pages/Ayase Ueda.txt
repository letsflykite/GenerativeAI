He also won Moriyasu's trust, and was frequently called up for the national team, having participated in 5 out of the 6 matches the national team played in from March to June. After this improvement in club performances, alongside more game-time with the national team, reportedly caught some overseas interest. On 1 July 2022, he was unveiled as [[Cercle Brugge K.S.V.|Cercle Brugge]] new signing, joining the club in a complete transfer. After passing the medical check, he signed a 4-season contract, lasting to June 2026.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.antlers.co.jp/news/release/88562|title=上田選手のサークル・ブルージュKSV完全移籍合意|trans-title=Agreement on Ayase Ueda's transfer to Cercle Brugge|language=ja|publisher=Kashima Antlers|access-date=1 July 2022}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cerclebrugge.be/nl/news/princiepsakkoord-ayase-ueda-naar-cercle-brugge|title=Princiepsakkoord: Ayase Ueda naar Cercle Brugge|language=nl|publisher=Cercle Brugge|access-date=1 July 2022}}</ref>
