==Club career==
===Inter Allies===
He started his professional football career at [[International Allies F.C.|Inter Allies]] in the [[First Capital Plus Premier League]]. In 2013–14, Aidoo was nominated in the category Defender of the year in the domestic top tier, but eventually missed out on the award. Aidoo was the club [[Captain (association football)|captain]] during the season of 2014–15.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.interalliesfc.com/official-captain-joseph-aidoo-loaned-to-hammarby/ |title=Captain Joseph Aidoo loaned to Hammarby|publisher=[[International Allies F.C.]] |access-date= 27 January 2016|language=en}}</ref>

===Hammarby IF===
In August 2015, Swedish club [[Hammarby Fotboll|Hammarby IF]] in [[Allsvenskan]] signed Aidoo on a six-month loan deal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hammarbyfotboll.se/Article.aspx?id=7a9362fe-6258-47de-b0a0-b163be53a0d3 |title=Hammarby värvar mittbackslöfte |publisher=[[Hammarby Fotboll]] |access-date=27 January 2016 |language=sv |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303194550/http://www.hammarbyfotboll.se/Article.aspx?id=7a9362fe-6258-47de-b0a0-b163be53a0d3 |archive-date= 3 March 2016 }}</ref> He made his debut, and his only appearance during the 2015 season, against then reigning champions [[Malmö FF]] on 25 October 2015. Even though Hammarby lost with a score of 0–1, Aidoo put on an impressive performance being voted Hammarby player of the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hammarbyfotboll.se/Article.aspx?id=710ccc28-0cd2-4b4a-9f25-7cad0c85a156 |title=Matchens Lirare i Bajen: Joseph Aidoo |publisher=[[Hammarby Fotboll]] |access-date=27 January 2016 |language=sv |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101121923/http://www.hammarbyfotboll.se/Article.aspx?id=710ccc28-0cd2-4b4a-9f25-7cad0c85a156 |archive-date=1 November 2015 }}</ref>
