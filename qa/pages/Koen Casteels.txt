'''Koen Casteels''' (born 25 June 1992) is a Belgian professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Bundesliga]] club [[VfL Wolfsburg]] and the [[Belgium national football team|Belgium national team]].

Formed at [[K.R.C. Genk|Genk]], he spent most of his professional career in Germany with [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim|1899 Hoffenheim]], [[Werder Bremen]] (loan) and [[VfL Wolfsburg]], making over 200 [[Bundesliga]] appearances.

Casteels made 37 appearances for Belgium up to [[Belgium national under-21 football team|under-21]] level. He was first called up for the senior team in 2013 and was part of their squad that came third at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

==Club career==
Casteels was developed at [[K.R.C. Genk]] where he was a teammate of fellow goalkeeper [[Thibaut Courtois]]. He was initially regarded as better than Courtois, but while he and several of the club's other goalkeepers were injured, Courtois broke into the team.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Terreur |first1=Kristof |title=Chelsea's Thibaut Courtois: from clumsy boy to top of the world |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/sep/20/chelsea-thibaut-courtois-profile |access-date=12 July 2018 |work=The Observer |date=20 September 2014}}</ref>

Casteels  was signed by [[VfL Wolfsburg]] from [[TSG 1899 Hoffenheim]] in January 2015, but spent the first six months of the three-and-a-half-year contract on loan at [[Werder Bremen]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Casteels über Werder nach Wolfsburg|language=de|url=http://www.weltfussball.de/news/_n1411722_/casteels-ueber-werder-nach-wolfsburg/|access-date=15 May 2018|publisher=Weltfussball.de|date=21 January 2015}}</ref> He played for Wolfsburg in the [[2015 DFL-Supercup]], saving from [[Xabi Alonso]] in the [[penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]] as his team won after a 1–1 draw.<ref name=supercup>{{cite news|last1=Dunbar|first1=Ross|title=Bendtner leads Wolfsburg over Bayern Munich on penalties in German Super Cup clash|url=http://www.foxsports.com/soccer/story/bendtner-leads-wolfsburg-over-bayern-munich-on-penalties-in-german-super-cup-clash-080115?vid=null|access-date=3 August 2015|work=Fox Sports|date=1 August 2015}}</ref>

When [[Diego Benaglio]] left Wolfsburg in June 2017, Casteels signed a new three-year contract with the club and was given the number 1 shirt.<ref>{{cite news|title=Keeper Casteels verlängert in Wolfsburg|language=de|url=http://www.weltfussball.de/news/_n2795372_/keeper-casteels-verlaengert-in-wolfsburg/|access-date=15 May 2018|publisher=Weltfussball.de|date=22 June 2017}}</ref> He appeared in all of the club's 34 Bundesliga matches during the 2017−18 season.

==International career==
Casteels was first called up to the senior [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] team in May 2013.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Belga |title=Thorgan Hazard, Maxime Lestienne et Koen Casteels appelés par Marc Wilmots |url=https://www.dhnet.be/sports/football/diablesrouges/2013/05/16/thorgan-hazard-maxime-lestienne-et-koen-casteels-appeles-par-marc-wilmots-5LPUYX5ZBFG6BNNFD74RFPLUYQ/ |access-date=6 July 2022 |website=DHnet |language=fr}}</ref> He was going to be part of Belgium's [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] squad but failed to recover from an injury and was replaced by [[Silvio Proto]] and then [[Sammy Bossut]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.sportingnews.com/au/other-sports/news/belgium-keeper-casteels-fails-in-fitness-bid/aj83sar7bt8m1l2113nd98lsz|title=Belgium keeper Casteels fails in fitness bid}}</ref>

Manager [[Roberto Martínez]] often chose four goalkeepers in his international selections, and as the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] only permitted three, Casteels battled with [[Matz Sels]] for the final space behind [[Thibaut Courtois]] and [[Simon Mignolet]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Poissonnier |first1=Niels |title=Casteels: "Je voelde een bepaalde angst" |url=https://www.hln.be/sport/voetbal/belgisch-voetbal/rode-duivels/casteels-je-voelde-een-bepaalde-angst~ab7f76c1/ |access-date=12 July 2018 |publisher=HLN |date=3 June 2017 |language=nl}}</ref> He was eventually chosen for the final 23-man squad to go to Russia.<ref>{{cite news |title=World Cup 2018: Belgium include Vincent Kompany but Christian Benteke misses out |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44353673 |access-date=12 July 2018 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=4 June 2018}}</ref>

Casteels made his full international debut on 8 September 2020, in a 5–1 win over [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] for the [[2020–21 UEFA Nations League A#Group 2|UEFA Nations League]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Belgium v Iceland |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/54002963 |access-date=8 September 2020 |publisher=BBC Sport |date=8 September 2020}}</ref>
