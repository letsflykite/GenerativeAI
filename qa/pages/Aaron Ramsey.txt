'''Aaron James Ramsey''' (born 26 December 1990) is a Welsh professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[midfielder]] for [[Ligue 1]] club [[OGC Nice|Nice]] and [[Captain (association football)|captains]] the [[Wales national football team|Wales national team]]. Ramsey mainly plays as a [[Midfielder#Box-to-box midfielder|box-to-box midfielder]], but has also been deployed on the left and right [[Midfielder#Winger|wings]].

He played as a schoolboy for [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]], where he spent eight years in youth football, became the club's youngest ever first team player, and made 28 appearances (including loan spell) for the senior team&nbsp;– including the [[2008 FA Cup Final]]. Ramsey moved to Arsenal in 2008 in a £5&nbsp;million deal, where he quickly gained first-team experience. However, his career stalled significantly after he suffered a broken leg in a match against [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke City]] in February 2010. After two loan spells away from Arsenal, he returned to full fitness and re-established himself as a regular starter during the [[2011–12 Arsenal F.C. season|2011–12 season]]. He also represented [[Great Britain men's Olympic football team|Great Britain]] at the [[Football at the 2012 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2012 Summer Olympics]]. Ramsey was a key player for Arsenal in the [[2013–14 Arsenal F.C. season|2013–14 campaign]], scoring 16 goals in all competitions, including the winner in the [[2014 FA Cup Final]] against [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. He also played in the [[2015 FA Cup Final]], which Arsenal won,<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.gazzetta.it/Calcio_Estero/Premierleague/13-02-2012/ramsey-macabra-statistica-se-segna-muore-famoso-81326265995.shtml |title=Ramsey, macabra statistica Se segna muore un vip |first=Simona |last=Marchetti |newspaper=La Gazzetta dello Sport |date=13 February 2012 |language=it}}</ref> and scored a second FA Cup winning goal in [[2017 FA Cup Final|2017]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2017/may/27/arsenal-v-chelsea-2017-fa-cup-final-live |title=Arsenal 2–1 Chelsea |date=28 May 2017 |newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref> On 1 July 2019, he joined [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] after having signed a pre-contractual agreement, winning the league title during his first season. In 2022, he joined French side Nice.

Ramsey made his full international debut for Wales in 2008 and was part of their [[UEFA Euro 2016]] campaign, where he helped his country to the semi-finals and was included in the Team of the Tournament. He was instrumental in securing qualification for [[UEFA Euro 2020]], the country's second successive European tournament, and at the delayed tournament, Wales made it to the last 16. Ramsey was also a member of the squad that qualified for the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], becoming the first team to do so since 1958, which he described it as a "dream come true".<ref>{{Cite web |last=McAvoy |first=Callum |date=5 June 2022 |title='Little old Wales are going to the World Cup!' – Ramsey after win over Ukraine |url=https://metro.co.uk/2022/06/05/aaron-ramsey-reacts-to-wales-beating-ukraine-to-reach-qatar-world-cup-16773967/ |access-date=14 June 2022 |website=Metro |language=en}}</ref>
