'''Mitchell Thomas Duke''' (born 18 January 1991) is an Australian international [[Association football|soccer]] player who plays for [[FC Machida Zelvia|Machida Zelvia]] in the [[J2 League]]. Duke was born in [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]], [[New South Wales]] and played youth soccer with [[Paramatta Eagles]] before starting his professional career with [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]]. He joined [[J-League]] side [[Shimizu S-Pulse]] and [[Fagiano Okayama]] in 2015 and 2021 respectively.

He represented Australia at the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]], and Australia Olympic at the [[Football at the 2020 Summer Olympics – Men's tournament|2020 Summer Olympics]].

==Early life==
Duke was born in [[Liverpool, New South Wales|Liverpool]], in [[Sydney]]'s south-west. He attended [[All Saints Catholic College, Liverpool]] and [[All Saints Catholic Senior College|All Saints Catholic Senior College Casula]].

==Club career==
Duke began his career with [[Parramatta Eagles]] before moving into the [[Central Coast Mariners]]' youth team. On 9 February 2011, Duke made his senior debut for the Mariners and also scored his first goal in a 3–1 win over [[Gold Coast United FC|Gold Coast United]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-02-09/mariners-blow-gold-coast-away/1936660|title=Mariners blow Gold Coast away|date=9 February 2011|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]|access-date=14 October 2014}}</ref>

On 24 January 2012, it was announced he had signed his first senior contract signing a two-year contract with [[Central Coast Mariners FC|Central Coast Mariners]].<ref>{{cite news|publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]|title=Mariners re-sign young defender Sainsbury|date=24 January 2012|access-date=14 October 2014|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-01-24/mariners-renew-young-defender-sainsbury/3791204}}</ref>

In August 2013, Duke had a two-week trial with [[English Premier League]] side [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/football/mitchell-duke-says-experience-of-training-with-west-ham-will-help-him-in-upcoming-a-league-season-with-central-coast-mariners/story-fnii0fg0-1226701567778?nk=3a8fd63acac6445a546ef9219ec56dbe|title=Mitchell Duke says experience of training with West Ham will help him in upcoming A-League season with Central Coast Mariners|date=21 August 2013|author=Smithies, Tom|newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)]]|access-date=14 October 2014}}</ref>

In the 2012–13 season, Duke scored 6 goals from 21 games. In the 2013–14 season, he was not as prolific, scoring 3 goals in 29 games. In the 2014–15 season, he had 3 goals from 15 games.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://int.soccerway.com/players/mitchell--duke/175952/|title = Australia - M. Duke - Profile with news, career statistics and history|website=Soccerway}}</ref> The decrease in goals can be attributed to Duke being played increasingly on the right wing by coach [[Phil Moss]] rather than the centre forward position he began his career playing.

On 9 February 2015, Duke announced that he was flying to Japan to complete a move to [[Shimizu S-Pulse]].<ref>[http://www.a-league.com.au/article/duke-takes-j-league-opportunity/u4tmffvhqrq41ssc427e35hv7 Duke takes J-League opportunity]</ref> In April 2016, Duke suffered an [[anterior cruciate ligament injury]], ruling him out of football for at least six months.<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://www.fourfourtwo.com/au/news/duke-suffers-long-term-injury#:PbW0NnWYG53njA|title=Duke suffers long-term injury|magazine=[[FourFourTwo]]|date=24 April 2016|access-date=25 April 2016|author=Somerford, Ben}}</ref>

Duke left Shimizu in December 2018, after four seasons with the club.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Thomas |first1=Josh |title=Mitchell Duke eyes European move after Japanese adventure ends in frustration |url=https://www.goal.com/en-au/news/mitchell-duke-eyes-european-move-after-japanese-adventure/15e9u3mmr2wnw1viirwal8tmsn |publisher=Goal.com |access-date=30 December 2018}}</ref>

On 25 January 2019, Duke announced that he had moved back home and signed with Western Sydney Wanderers FC and captained the club.

On 22 August 2020, Duke signed a two-year deal with [[Al-Taawoun FC|Al-Taawoun]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.alarabiya.net/ar/sport/2020/08/22/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AF-%D9%85%D8%B9-%D9%85%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%85-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%AF%D9%86%D9%8A|title= التعاون يتعاقد مع مهاجم سيدني}}</ref> He scored the winning goal against [[Al-Duhail SC|Al-Duhail]] in a [[2020 AFC Champions League|AFC Champions League]] group stage fixture on 25 September 2020 but fell out of favour with the club leadership shortly after, having moved from his forward position to the wing.
