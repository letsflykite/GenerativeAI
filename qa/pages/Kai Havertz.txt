'''Kai Lukas Havertz''' (born 11 June 1999) is a German professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as an [[attacking midfielder]] or [[Forward (association football)|forward]] for {{English football updater|Arsenal}} club [[Arsenal FC|Arsenal]] and the [[Germany national football team|Germany national team]].

Having graduated from [[Bayer 04 Leverkusen|Bayer Leverkusen]]'s youth academy in 2016, Havertz made his senior debut with the club at the same year. Upon making his debut, Havertz became the club's youngest-ever debutant in the [[Bundesliga]], and he became their youngest-ever goalscorer when he scored his first goal the following year. He is also the youngest player to reach the milestones of 50 and 100 league appearances in the German top flight.

Havertz's performances sparked the interest of several European clubs, with [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] signing him in 2020 for a transfer worth €84&nbsp;million (£72&nbsp;million), making him Chelsea's [[List of Chelsea F.C. records and statistics#Highest transfer fees paid|second-most expensive signing]] at the time. With Chelsea, Havertz won the [[2020–21 UEFA Champions League|UEFA Champions League]], [[2021 UEFA Super Cup|UEFA Super Cup]], and the [[2021 FIFA Club World Cup|FIFA Club World Cup]] in 2021, scoring the winning goals in the Champions League and Club World Cup finals.

After appearing for Germany at various youth levels, Havertz made his senior international debut in September 2018, becoming the first player born in 1999 to represent the national team. He represented Germany at [[UEFA Euro 2020]] and the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]].

==Player profile==
===Style of play===
Havertz has been described as a technically gifted, two-footed attacking midfielder who is comfortable with the ball on either foot and adept with his head. During his formative years, his style of play drew early comparisons to compatriot [[Mesut Özil]], with Havertz himself admitting the midfielder was a player he looked up to.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/sport/fussball/bundesliga/bayer-leverkusen/article162224749/Dieser-17-Jaehrige-gilt-als-Deutschlands-neuer-Oezil.html |title=Dieser 17-Jährige gilt als Deutschlands neuer Özil |newspaper=Die Welt |location=Berlin |last=Wallrodt |first=Lars |date=21 February 2017 |access-date=6 April 2017 |archive-date=7 April 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170407054925/https://www.welt.de/sport/fussball/bundesliga/bayer-leverkusen/article162224749/Dieser-17-Jaehrige-gilt-als-Deutschlands-neuer-Oezil.html |url-status=live }}{{in lang|de}}</ref> By the age of 19, and following numerous impressive performances in the Bundesliga, further comparisons had been drawn between Havertz and former Leverkusen players such as [[Michael Ballack]] and [[Toni Kroos]] and some began describing him as a combination of all three and an ''Alleskönner'' – a player who can do everything.<ref name="desc">{{cite web|date=15 October 2018|title=Kai Havertz becoming the real deal at Bayer Leverkusen|url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/kai-havertz-becoming-bayer-leverkusen-real-deal-513972.jsp|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181015192353/https://www.bundesliga.com/en/news/Bundesliga/kai-havertz-becoming-bayer-leverkusen-real-deal-513972.jsp|archive-date=15 October 2018|access-date=15 October 2018|publisher=Bundesliga}}</ref> He has also been compared with [[Thomas Müller]], as they both have the talent for finding spaces in congested areas and making the right runs, although Havertz has been described as a more elegant and skilful player than Müller.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Germany's new Raumdeuter Kai Havertz arrives on the international scene just when they needed him most |url=https://theathletic.com/2661322 |date=19 June 2021 |last=Honigstein |first=Raphael |work=The Athletic }}</ref> Havertz prefers the ''false nine'' role, which he played at Chelsea.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Kai Havertz exclusive: Chelsea forward reflects on his own form, playing as a false nine, and must-win matches |url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/15116/12312528/kai-havertz-exclusive-chelsea-forward-reflects-on-his-own-form-playing-as-a-false-nine-and-must-win-matches |date=22 May 2021 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20210522133211/https://www.skysports.com/football/news/15116/12312528/kai-havertz-exclusive-chelsea-forward-reflects-on-his-own-form-playing-as-a-false-nine-and-must-win-matches |archive-date=22 May 2021 |last=Smith |first=Peter |work=Sky Sports }}</ref> However, during the 2021–22 season, he had no specific position and was experimented in different positions, though his best streak came when he played centrally as a forward/false nine, roles that he is very familiar with.<ref>{{Cite web |date=1 March 2022 |title=It's safe to say Chelsea has found Kai Havertz's best position |url=https://theprideoflondon.com/2022/03/01/safe-say-chelsea-found-kai-havertzs-best-position/ |access-date=30 May 2022 |website=The Pride of London |language=en-US}}</ref>
