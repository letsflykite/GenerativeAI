'''Carlos Manuel Brito Leal de Queiroz''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Prince Henry|ComIH]]}} ({{IPA-pt|ˈkaɾluʃ kɐjˈɾɔʃ}}; born 1 March 1953) is a Portuguese [[association football|football]] coach who currently is the head coach of the [[Qatar national football team|Qatar national team]]. He has served as the manager of his native [[Portugal national football team|Portugal's national team]], the [[United Arab Emirates national football team|United Arab Emirates]], [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]], [[Iran national football team|Iran]], [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]] and [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]], leading South Africa ([[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002]]), Portugal ([[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010]]) and Iran ([[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014]], [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]], and [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022]]) to the [[FIFA World Cup]]. At club level, he has also managed [[Sporting CP]], the [[New York Red Bulls|New York/New Jersey Metrostars]] in [[Major League Soccer]] and Spanish club [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]]. He also had two spells as [[Alex Ferguson]]'s assistant manager at English club [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].

Queiroz has won several awards as a coach in junior levels, and has been successful at senior and club levels, mainly as Alex Ferguson's assistant manager. In 1998, he authored the ''[[Project 2010|Q-Report]]'', which detailed plans to enhance footballer development in the United States.

Queiroz is the longest-serving [[List of Iran national football team managers|manager]] in the history of the Iran national team, serving for almost eight years between 2011 and 2019. He returned to the role for Iran's 2022 World Cup campaign. He is the only manager in the country's history to lead them at three consecutive World Cups.

==Career==
Born in [[Nampula]], [[Portuguese Mozambique]], to Portuguese parents, Queiroz had an undistinguished professional career as a footballer, playing as a goalkeeper in Mozambique before turning to management. He moved to Portugal following Portugal's [[Carnation Revolution]] on 25 April 1974, and [[History of Mozambique#Independence (1975)|Mozambique's declaration of independence]] in 1975.<ref name="Queiroz joins Man Utd">{{cite news |title=Queiroz joins Man Utd |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/2029504.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=6 June 2002 |access-date=20 June 2007 }}</ref> Queiroz is a graduate of the [[University of Lisbon]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://football.fmh.ulisboa.pt/meet-faculty-of-human-kinetics/|title=Meet Faculty of Human Kinetics - University of Lisbon|work=High Performance Football Coaching|access-date=4 June 2018}}</ref> He coached the [[Portugal national under-20 football team|Portuguese under-20 side]] to two [[FIFA U-20 World Cup|FIFA World Youth Championship]] wins, in the [[1989 FIFA World Youth Championship|1989]] and [[1991 FIFA World Youth Championship|1991 tournaments]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.portugoal.net/index.php/more-portugal-news/10721-queiroz-responds-to-mourinho |title=Queiroz responds to Mourinho |access-date=8 May 2014 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100613001138/http://portugoal.net/index.php/more-portugal-news/10721-queiroz-responds-to-mourinho |archive-date=13 June 2010 }}</ref>

===Early senior career===
In 1984, Queiroz was appointed as assistant manager of [[G.D. Estoril Praia|Estoril-Praia]]. After that, Queiroz was appointed [[Portugal national football team|senior national team]] coach in 1991. He had a record of 14 wins in 31 matches.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.rsssf.org/miscellaneous/port-coach-triv.html |title=PORTUGUESE NATIONAL TEAM COACHES |access-date=20 June 2007 |first=Maxim |last=Olenev |website=[[RSSSF]] |date=28 June 1999 }}</ref> Afterwards, he went on to manage the Portuguese [[Primeira Liga|Primeira Divisão]] team [[Sporting CP]] in 1994.

He subsequently coached the [[New York Red Bulls|NY/NJ MetroStars]] in the United States and the Japanese team, [[Nagoya Grampus|Nagoya Grampus Eight]]. In between, he found time to author the ''[[Project 2010|Q-Report]]'', detailing plans to professionalize the development of footballers in the United States. Queiroz returned to coaching national teams in 1999, when he took the job as head coach of the [[United Arab Emirates national football team|United Arab Emirates]], before becoming head coach of [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] in 2000. Under Queiroz, South Africa qualified for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], but Queiroz resigned in March 2002 before the finals after falling out with the [[South African Football Association]].<ref>{{cite news |date=12 March 2002 |title=Queiroz quits |url=http://www.news24.com/xArchive/Sport/Soccer/Queiroz-quits-20020312 |work=[[News24 (website)|News24]] |access-date=11 October 2017}}</ref> Queiroz was part of FIFA XI coaching staff, alongside Brazilian [[Carlos Alberto Parreira]], in a humanitarian friendly match played in [[Siege of Sarajevo|war-torn]] Sarajevo against [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 25 April 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rsssf.org/miscellaneous/fifa-xi.html|title=Matches of FIFA XI|website=[[RSSSF]]|access-date=4 June 2018}}</ref>

Queiroz became a coach at English club Manchester United in June 2002. He began his work at the start of the [[2002–03 FA Premier League|2002–03]] season, working alongside Alex Ferguson, who had gone without an assistant manager since the departure of [[Steve McClaren]] in the middle of 2001.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.express.co.uk/sport/football/394306/Steve-McClaren-Ruthless-Sir-Alex-Ferguson-is-the-real-fighter|title=Steve McClaren: Ruthless Sir Alex Ferguson is the real fighter|last=Hickman|first=Niall|date=24 April 2013|work=Express.co.uk|access-date=4 June 2018}}</ref>

===Real Madrid===
Queiroz's position at Manchester United as assistant manager attracted the attention of [[Real Madrid CF|Real Madrid]], who wanted Queiroz as their manager to replace departing manager [[Vicente del Bosque]] in the summer of 2003. It was an opportunity to work with [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] award winners [[Zinedine Zidane]], [[Ronaldo (Brazilian footballer)|Ronaldo]] and [[Luís Figo]], an opportunity that Queiroz felt unable to turn down. He was appointed on a two-year contract, only a week after the arrival of Manchester United player [[David Beckham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elmundo.es/elmundodeporte/2003/06/24/futbol/1056477695.html|title=Queiroz vuelve a Manchester para negociar su salida del United - Fútbol|website=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|date=24 June 2003|language=es}}</ref> In the same summer, Real Madrid lost veteran defender [[Fernando Hierro]], defensive midfielder [[Claude Makélélé]] and striker [[Fernando Morientes]].<ref name=nyt/>

Real Madrid got off to a good start of the [[2003–04 La Liga|2003–04]] season, defeating [[RCD Mallorca|Mallorca]] in the [[Supercopa de España]].<ref>{{cite news |title=Real Madrid takes the Supercup |url=https://www.taipeitimes.com/News/sport/archives/2003/08/29/2003065759 |access-date=7 March 2023 |work=Taipei Times |date=29 August 2003}}</ref> By mid-season, the team topped the [[La Liga]] table and was in contention for the [[Copa del Rey]] and the [[UEFA Champions League]] trophies. However, they lost their final five matches and finished in fourth place, with [[Valencia CF|Valencia]] winning the title. They lost the [[2004 Copa del Rey Final|Copa del Rey final]] to [[Real Zaragoza]] and were eliminated from the Champions League in the quarter-finals by Morientes's new team [[AS Monaco FC|Monaco]] after a 4–2 first leg win, ending the season with the Supercopa de España as the only trophy won, the first time in five years without a major trophy. Following ten months at the [[Santiago Bernabéu Stadium]], Queiroz was sacked in May 2004.<ref>{{cite news |title=Real sack Queiroz |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/3742779.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=24 May 2004 |access-date=20 June 2007 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Fifield |first1=Dominic |title=Morientes power sends Real crashing out |work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/apr/07/match.championsleague1 |access-date=7 March 2023 |date=6 April 2004}}</ref><ref name=nyt>{{cite news |last1=Hughes |first1=Rob |title=Soccer : Worst of times for Real Madrid |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/04/14/sports/IHT-soccer-worst-of-times-for-real-madrid.html |access-date=7 March 2023 |work=The New York Times |date=14 April 2004}}</ref>

===Return to Manchester United===
[[File:Ferguson and Queiroz.jpg|thumb|upright|Queiroz with Sir Alex Ferguson during the [[Manchester derby]] against [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] on 10 February 2008]]
Queiroz returned to United as Ferguson's assistant in June 2004. Some sources noted the effect of his absence on the club's 2003–04 season, in which they came third in the league and exited early from the Champions League.<ref>{{cite news |title=Queiroz returns to United |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2004/jun/04/newsstory.sport6 |access-date=4 January 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=4 June 2004}}</ref>

[[File:Carlos Queiroz.JPG|thumb|upright|left|Queiroz at Old Trafford during a match between Manchester United and [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] on 12 August 2007]]
In his 2014 autobiography, United [[Captain (association football)|captain]] [[Roy Keane]] stated that an argument with Queiroz about loyalty was one of the reasons why the Irishman quit the club in 2005.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Taylor |first1=Daniel |title=Roy Keane reveals details behind his explosive Manchester United exit |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/oct/06/roy-keane-manchester-united-sir-alex-ferguson |access-date=4 January 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=6 October 2014}}</ref> Keane said during [[ITV (TV channel)|ITV]]'s coverage of the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]] that "one of my big regrets is that I probably should have ripped his head off".<ref>{{cite news |title='I should have ripped his head off' – Roy Keane reveals rift with Iran boss and former Manchester United coach Carlos Queiroz |url=https://talksport.com/football/387852/i-should-have-ripped-his-head-off-roy-keane-reveals-rift-with-iran-boss-and-former-manchester-united-coach-carlos-queiroz/ |access-date=4 January 2020 |publisher=Talksport |date=21 June 2018}}</ref>

Queiroz was linked with managerial roles with Portuguese side [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]<ref>{{cite news |title=Benfica silent, but Queiroz announcement edges nearer |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=368360&cc=3888 |publisher=ESPN Soccernet |date=19 May 2006 |access-date=20 June 2007 |archive-date=24 October 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024134935/http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=368360&cc=3888 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]] in 2006 but he remained with Manchester United to help them win the Premier League in 2007. Queiroz was often seen conducting interviews with [[BBC]] programmes, such as ''[[Match of the Day]]'', as at the time Alex Ferguson refused to speak with the BBC after allegations by the BBC's ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' programme that Ferguson's younger son Jason, and [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] manager [[Harry Redknapp]], had been involved in corruption regarding cuts in transfer fees. Some of Queiroz's post-match opinions on refereeing were controversial. For example, in 2008 Queiroz was – unsuccessfully – charged with improper conduct by [[the Football Association]] after describing [[Referee (association football)|referee]] [[Martin Atkinson]]'s performance in a match as "a disgrace".<ref>{{cite news |title=Man Utd pair hit with FA charge |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/7286112.stm |publisher=BBC Sport|date=2 April 2008 |access-date=29 July 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Man Utd duo's charge 'not proved' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/7424315.stm |publisher=BBC Sport|date=28 May 2008 |access-date=29 July 2008 }}</ref>

In late March 2008, it was reported that Benfica had, once again, approached Queiroz to become their manager and had made a formal request to Manchester United.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Oliver |first1=Pete |url=https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-england-united-queiroz/ferguson-not-expecting-queiroz-to-move-to-benfica-idUKB34575620080328 |title=Ferguson not expecting Queiroz to move to Benfica |access-date=5 September 2020 |work=Reuters |date=29 March 2008}}</ref> United were heavily involved in the [[2007–08 Manchester United F.C. season#Premier League|2007–08 Premier League]] title race, five points clear at the top, with just seven games remaining, and also were still competing in the [[2007–08 Manchester United F.C. season#UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] – being in the quarter-finals at the time of the enquiry. Queiroz did not make any public response to the approach.

Following Benfica's approach, and amid rumors of an opening as the Portugal national coach, Alex Ferguson started to push for Queiroz to be his successor as manager at [[Old Trafford]] and discouraged any possible suitors from approaching him.<ref>{{cite web |title=Fergie states case for Queiroz |url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/23052008/1/fergie-states-case-queiroz.html}}</ref> However, rumours over the summer of 2008 continued to link Queiroz with the Portugal national team managers' role, following the departure of [[Luiz Felipe Scolari]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Daniel |title=Portugal target Queiroz as successor to Scolari |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jul/02/portugal.manchesterunited |access-date=5 September 2020 |work=The Guardian |date=2 July 2008}}</ref> On 11 July 2008, Manchester United agreed to release Queiroz from his contract, and he was appointed manager for the Portugal national team.

===Portugal===
On 11 July 2008, it was announced that Queiroz was leaving Manchester United, having agreed to a four-year contract to become the head coach of the Portugal national team.<ref name="CQ_Guardian">{{cite news |last=Adamson |first=Mike |title=Queiroz confirmed as Portugal manager |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media |date=11 July 2008 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2008/jul/11/portugal.manchesterunited |access-date=11 July 2008 |location=London}}</ref><ref name="CQ_Reuters_UK">{{cite news |last=Pontes |first=Carlos |title=Queiroz leaves Man United to become Portugal coach |work=uk.reuters.com |publisher=Thompson Reuters |date=12 July 2008 |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/sportsNews/idUKL1115675320080711 |access-date=12 July 2008}}</ref><ref name="CQ_BBC_Sport">{{cite news |title=Queiroz takes Portugal coach post |publisher=BBC Sport |date=11 July 2008 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/m/man_utd/7488580.stm |access-date=11 July 2008}}</ref><ref name="CQ_AP">{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Ferguson bids farewell to Queiroz, thanking him for rebuilding the team |series=Sports |work=International Herald Tribune |date=11 July 2008 |url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/07/11/sports/EU-SOC-Man-United-Queiroz.php |access-date=11 July 2008}}</ref>

Portugal struggled under his management during the qualification for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]]. Despite kick-starting their [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA Group 1|World Cup qualification]] campaign with a comfortable 4–0 win against [[Malta national football team|Malta]] in [[National Stadium, Ta' Qali|Ta' Qali]], Queiroz's team failed to win any of their subsequent four matches.

Home form was poor, with a 3–2 defeat to [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] followed by 0–0 draws against [[Albania national football team|Albania]] and [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]]. Together with another goalless draw in Stockholm against Sweden, these results left Portugal with only six points out of a possible 15 and on the brink of missing a major international tournament for the first time since 1998. Building on an improving reliability in defence, Portugal defeated Albania in Tirana 2–1 with a late goal, tied 1–1 against Denmark on 5 September, beat [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] 1–0 and again 3–0 in the return match, and finally defeated Malta 4–0. These results, together with a defeat of Sweden to Denmark, enabled Portugal to finish the campaign second in the group with 19 points, one ahead of Sweden, and qualify for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification – UEFA second round|UEFA play-offs]]. They played Bosnia and Herzegovina in home and away legs. Portugal won 1–0 in Lisbon and followed up with a 1–0 victory in [[Zenica]], and as a result they advanced to the finals of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]].

At the World Cup, Portugal drew 0–0 with the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] but then beat [[North Korea national football team|North Korea]] 7–0, the heaviest victory in the World Cup since [[Germany national football team|Germany]]'s 8–0 defeat of [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] in 2002. This rout virtually guaranteed Portugal passage to the second round and a second goalless draw with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] confirmed qualification. In the second round, they lost to [[Spain national football team|Spain]] 1–0 and were knocked out having failed to score in three of their four World Cup matches.

Quieroz was suspended for six months by the Portuguese Anti-Doping Authority (Autoridade Antidopagem de Portugal) on 30 August 2010, when he was judged to have disrupted their pre-World Cup procedures; he had been suspended for a month by the [[Portuguese Football Federation]] (FPF) for using inappropriate language towards the testers, a lesser charge that he admitted to.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2010/sep/02/carlos-queiroz-suspended-six-months-portugal|title=Carlos Queiroz suspended for six months for insulting anti-doping team|date=2 September 2009|access-date=25 March 2011|agency=Associated Press|work=The Guardian}}</ref> He was sacked by the FPF on 9 September.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://goal-arena.com/2010/09/carlos-queiroz-sacked-by-portugal/ |title=Carlos Queiroz sacked by Portugal |website=Goal-arena.com |access-date=9 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711103821/http://goal-arena.com/2010/09/carlos-queiroz-sacked-by-portugal/ |archive-date=11 July 2011 }}</ref>  On 23 March 2011, the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]] upheld his appeal against the Anti-Doping Authority, annulling his suspension.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.tas-cas.org/en/infogenerales.asp/4-3-4667-1092-4-1-1/5-0-1092-15-1-1/ |title=THE CAS ANNULS THE SUSPENSION OF CARLOS QUEIROZ |date=23 March 2011 |access-date=25 March 2011 |work=Court of Arbitration for Sport |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110326200703/http://www.tas-cas.org/en/infogenerales.asp/4-3-4667-1092-4-1-1/5-0-1092-15-1-1 |archive-date=26 March 2011 }}</ref>

===Iran===
On 4 April 2011, Queiroz agreed to a two-and-a-half-year deal to coach [[Iran national football team|Iran]] until the end of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup|2014 World Cup]] in Brazil<ref name="Goal">{{cite news |title=Carlos Queiroz agrees deal to become Iran head coach |publisher=Soccernet |date=4 April 2011 |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story/_/id/902584/carlos-queiroz-agrees-deal-to-become-iran-coach |access-date=4 April 2011 |location=Dubai }}</ref> alongside goalkeeping coach [[Dan Gaspar]] and assistant coach [[Omid Namazi]].

Since Queiroz's role as manager of the Iran national team, he has been renowned for introducing players from the [[Iranian diaspora]] to the national squad. These players include [[Iranians in Germany|German Iranians]] [[Daniel Davari]] and [[Ashkan Dejagah]], [[Iranians in the Netherlands|Dutch Iranian]] [[Reza Ghoochannejhad]], [[Swedish Iranians]] [[Omid Nazari]] and [[Saman Ghoddos]], and [[Iranian Americans|Iranian American]] [[Steven Beitashour]] among others.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/iran-players-watch-world-cup-23269497|title=5 Iran Players to Watch at the World Cup|work=[[ABC News]]|access-date=16 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140417091756/https://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/iran-players-watch-world-cup-23269497|archive-date=17 April 2014|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name="guardianmagath">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/18/asgkan-dejagah-felix-magath-fulham|title=Ashkan Dejagah says Felix Magath is the right man to keep Fulham up |work=The Guardian|date=18 April 2014 |access-date=19 April 2014}}</ref>

Queiroz was appointed manager of the [[Qatar national football team|Qatar national team]] in February 2023, succeeding [[Félix Sánchez (football manager)|Félix Sánchez]], who led them at the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]] which they hosted.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Queiroz appointed Qatar head coach |language=en-GB |work=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/64554297 |access-date=2023-02-07}}</ref>

==Controversy==
Prior to the final 2014 World Cup qualification match against South Korea, Queiroz was angered by the comment made from [[Choi Kang-hee (footballer)|Choi Kang-hee]], the head coach of South Korea, who complained that Iran did not provide the training facilities with sufficient qualities during South Korea's away qualification match against Iran on 17 October 2012. Choi stated that South Korea would defeat Iran to help Uzbekistan qualify for the World Cup finals with South Korea, and that Iran would have to watch the World Cup on television. In response, Queiroz severely criticized Choi in his official comments and mocked him by wearing a T-shirt displaying Choi's face.<ref>{{cite news |date=18 June 2013 |title=Soccer-Queiroz has last laugh as Koreans turn on departing Choi |work=Reuters |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/soccer-world-korea-iran/soccer-queiroz-has-last-laugh-as-koreans-turn-on-departing-choi-idUKL3N0EU3DJ20130618 |access-date=5 September 2020}}</ref>

[[List of violent spectator incidents in sports#2013|After Iran's victory]] against South Korea in their final qualification match, Queiroz showed his anger at the South Korean national coach with a [[raised fist]] gesture, which was deemed offensive by the South Korean players and staff, almost causing a fight between the two teams.<ref>{{cite web |title=Colombia football coach wants to move on from past incident vs. S.
