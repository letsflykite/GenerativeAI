'''Atiba Hutchinson''' (born 8 February 1983) is a Canadian professional [[association football|soccer]] player who plays as a [[midfielder]]. While playing in [[Denmark]] he won the Danish Super Liga Player of the Year, becoming the first North American player to receive the award. That same season, Hutchinson won the first of six [[Canadian International Player of the Year|Canadian Player of the Year]] awards. Between 2010 and 2013, he played for [[PSV Eindhoven]] in the [[Dutch Eredivisie]]. He is widely considered as the greatest Canadian soccer player of all time. 

In 2012 as part of the [[Canadian Soccer Association]]'s centennial celebration, he was named to the all-time Canada XI men's team.<ref name=alltime>{{Cite web|url=http://www.canadasoccer.com/association-announces-all-time-canada-xi-men-s-team-p150746&t=article_canadasoccer100|title=Association announces All-Time Canada XI - men's team|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140626042541/https://www.canadasoccer.com/association-announces-all-time-canada-xi-men-s-team-p150746&t=article_canadasoccer100|archive-date=26 June 2014|url-status=dead|work=[[Canadian Soccer Association]]}}</ref> Hutchinson is Canada's record cap holder and the first male Canadian soccer player to reach over 100 caps.

===Öster===
In January 2003 he signed with [[Östers IF]], newly promoted to the Swedish [[Allsvenskan]]. Hutchinson scored six times for Öster during the 2003 season. With the club relegated out of the Allsvenskan, Hutchinson was granted a transfer for an estimated £1.32 million and signed with [[Helsingborgs IF]] in January 2004.

===Helsingborg===
Expectations were high for him the first season in Helsingborg, but they were ultimately unsatisfied.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11694/2338797/|title=Canadian claims Blues interest|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229205047/http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11694/2338797/|archive-date=29 December 2013|url-status=dead|work=[[Sky Sports]]|first=Peter|last=O'Rourke|date=29 December 2013}}</ref> However, in the 2005 season he was consistently the team's best player, scoring six goals from a primarily defensive midfield position.

===Copenhagen===
[[File:Atiba Hutchinson 2008.jpg|thumb|left|Hutchinson signing autographs in 2008]]
Hutchinson moved to Danish club [[F.C. Copenhagen]],<ref name="Brampton's Atiba Hutchinson voted Canada's top male soccer player"/> where, for the first half of the year, he played alongside Swedish international [[Tobias Linderoth]] in central midfield, latterly being used around the midfield and as a striker. Manager [[Ståle Solbakken]] said in an interview with the football paper ''TIPS-bladet'', that he saw Hutchinson's attacking talents as being too impressive for a central midfielder, saying that he would be used more often as winger.<ref>{{Citation | last = Pyndt | first = Thomas | title = Kampen om midtbanen | newspaper = [[Tipsbladet]] |url=https://www.tipsbladet.dk/nyhed/generelle/kampen-om-midtbanen | date = 23 February 2007|language=Danish|trans-title=Battle for Midfield}}</ref> He was linked with [[Premier League]] clubs several times.

After Hutchinson had left Denmark for his new team in the [[Eredivisie]] he was awarded Danish Super Liga Player of the Year for his last season with Copenhagen.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/sports/2010-11/16/c_13608686.htm|title=Denmark {{as written|anno|nces [sic]}} year's soccer awards|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022165120/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/sports/2010-11/16/c_13608686.htm|archive-date=22 October 2013|first=Tang|last=Danlu|date=16 November 2010|work=Xinhua Net}}</ref> This award was given on 15 November 2010 by [[Franz Beckenbauer]] at the annual [[Danish Football Association]] award show. This was the first time a Canadian had won this award in the Danish League.

In 2014, 32,000 fans participated in a fan vote selecting their 11 all-time favourite Copenhagen players, selecting Hutchinson in the midfield.<ref name=allstar>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fck.dk/nyhed/her-er-fc-koebenhavn-all-stars|title=Her er F.C.

==International career==
[[Image:Atiba Hutchinsonperu.jpg|thumb|165px|right|Hutchinson playing against [[Peru national football team|Peru]] at [[BMO Field]] on 4 September 2010]]

The early years of Hutchinson's international career included appearances at both the [[2001 FIFA World Youth Championship|2001]] and [[2003 FIFA World Youth Championship]]s. He made his senior debut for [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] in a January 2003 friendly match against the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]]. That same year, he appeared in the [[2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2003 edition]] of the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]] and would go on to appear in five subsequent editions in the following two decades ([[2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2005]], [[2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2007]], [[2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2009]], [[2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2011]] and [[2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2019]]).<ref name="Canada Soccer profile"/> 

Canada reached the semi-finals of the [[2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], another match against the United States, which was the site of one of the most controversial moments in Hutchinson's career. With Canada down 2–1 in regulation time, Hutchinson scored a goal in the final minute of stoppage time, having received a ball that bounced off the head of American defender [[Oguchi Onyewu]]. However, the goal was ruled offside by referee [[Benito Archundia]], as a result of which the United States won the game and proceeded to the final. Both then and subsequently, many believed that Archundia's call was incorrect.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/22/sports/soccer/22goldcup.html|first1=Duncan|last1=Irving|date=22 June 2007|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|title=Controversy Follows United States Into Gold Cup Final}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/2007/06/22/canada_fuming_over_referees_offside_call_in_injury_time.html |first1=Duncan|last1=Irving|date=22 June 2007|newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]]|title=Canada fuming over referee's offside call in injury time}}</ref><ref name=Athletic220323>{{cite web|url=https://theathletic.com/3199904/2022/03/23/a-nation-behind-us-in-atiba-hutchinsons-last-run-to-the-world-cup-canada-is-finally-with-him/ |first1=Joshua |last1=Kloke |first2=Dan|last2=Robson|date=23 March 2022|website=[[The Athletic]]|title='A nation behind us': In Atiba Hutchinson's last run to the World Cup, Canada is finally with him}}</ref>

On 17 December 2010, Hutchinson was awarded the [[Canadian International Player of the Year|Canadian Men's Player of the Year]] by the [[Canadian Soccer Association|CSA]] for the first time in his career. Hutchinson was heavily favoured for this award in 2010 for his play with the national team, joining a well-known European club and becoming the first Canadian to win the Danish Superliga Player of the Year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://canadasoccer.com/news/viewArtical.asp?Press_ID=4606|title=Atiba Hutchinson is the male selection for 2010 award|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708114422/http://canadasoccer.com/news/viewArtical.asp?Press_ID=4606|archive-date=8 July 2011|date=17 December 2010|work=[[Canadian Soccer Association]]|url-status=dead}}</ref> Selected to the [[2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup]] squad, Hutchinson exited the tournament following a 0–2 loss to the Americans at [[Ford Field]] after sustaining a knee injury. He was forced to miss the rest of the tournament.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rednationonline.ca/XIoutof10CANvGuadeloupe61211.aspx|title=XI out of 10: CAN v Guadeloupe|first=Steve|last=Bottjer|work=RedNation Online|date=12 June 2011}}</ref>

For much of Hutchinson's career, Canada was not able to field a genuinely competitive international team, and qualification to the [[FIFA World Cup]] persistently eluded them. As part of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|CONCACAF qualification process]] for the [[2014 FIFA World Cup]] in [[Brazil]], Canada was on the verge of reaching the final stage of CONCACAF qualification for the first time since 1998. Going into its final game of the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification – CONCACAF third round|third round]] against [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] in [[San Pedro Sula]] on October 16, 2012, Canada needed only a draw to reach the fourth and final stage of qualification. Instead, the team was routed in an 8–1 victory for Honduras, its worst loss in almost thirty years.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/canada-suffers-humiliating-8-1-defeat-to-end-world-cup-hopes-1.1133876|date=16 October 2012|website=[[CBC Sports]]|title=Canada suffers humiliating 8-1 defeat to end World Cup hopes}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://torontosun.com/2016/08/31/reflecting-on-canadas-soccer-humiliation|first1=Kurt|last1=Larson|date=31 August 2016|newspaper=[[The Toronto Sun]]|title=Canada returns to Honduras with 8-1 loss still fresh}}</ref> That game would come to be regarded as the lowest point in the team's history by many.<ref name=Athletic220323/> Hutchinson was again named Canada Soccer's male player of the year to end 2012, and affirmed that he hoped to pursue another World Cup qualification, saying "It would still mean everything to me if I could be part of the team and give another go at it."<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.thestar.com/sports/soccer/2012/12/12/atiba_hutchinson_named_canadas_male_soccer_player_of_the_year.html |first1=Daniel|last1=Girard|date=12 December 2012|newspaper=[[The Toronto Star]]|title=Atiba Hutchinson named Canada's male soccer player of the year}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.canadasoccer.com/hutchinson-is-male-selection-for-2012-bmo-canadian-players-of-the-year-award-p152839|title=Hutchinson is male selection for 2012 BMO Canadian Players of the Year award|work=[[Canadian Soccer Association]]|archive-date=7 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131007094728/https://www.canadasoccer.com/hutchinson-is-male-selection-for-2012-bmo-canadian-players-of-the-year-award-p152839|url-status=dead|date=12 December 2012}}</ref>

Hutchinson was once again awarded the 2015 [[Canadian International Player of the Year|Canadian Men's Player of the Year]] by the [[Canadian Soccer Association|CFA]], marking his fourth straight award and fifth in the last six years. He went on to win the title again in 2016 and 2017.<ref name="Canada Soccer profile"/> However, Canada would not fare any better in attempting to qualify for the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], failing to advance to the [[2018 FIFA World Cup qualification – CONCACAF fifth round|fifth round]] of CONCACAF qualification. Disillusioned and believing that his best years had been wasted with the team, Hutchinson would later say that "in my head, I was done. I wasn't coming back to Canada, I swear."<ref name=Athletic220323/>

After declining to participate in 2016 and 2017 friendly matches and missing the [[2017 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], Hutchinson was persuaded to rejoin by coach [[John Herdman]], newly arrived from Canada's much more successful [[Canada women's national soccer team|women's national team]]. Herdman believed Hutchinson would add a valuable veteran presence to a team of up-and-coming talents like [[Alphonso Davies]] and [[Jonathan David]].<ref name=Athletic220323/> Upon his recall to the team in October 2018, he indicated he was looking to retire from the Canadian national team after the [[2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://canpl.ca/video/canada-stalwart-hutchinson-set-for-international-retirement-after-2019-gold-cup|first=Armen|date=14 October 2018|last=Bedakian|title=Canada stalwart Atiba Hutchinson set for international retirement after 2019 Gold Cup|work=[[Canadian Premier League]]}}</ref> He was named to the squad for that tournament on 30 May 2019.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.canadasoccer.com/together-we-rise-canada-soccer-announces-squad-for-the-2019-concacaf-gold-cup-p162198|date=30 May 2019|title=Together We Rise: Canada Soccer announces squad for the 2019 Concacaf Gold Cup|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190603025211/https://www.canadasoccer.com/together-we-rise-canada-soccer-announces-squad-for-the-2019-concacaf-gold-cup-p162198|archive-date=3 June 2019|url-status=dead|work=[[Canadian Soccer Association]]}}</ref>

Hutchinson however remained active for Canada, and in March 2021 he accepted a call-up for [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|2022 FIFA World Cup qualifiers]] against [[Bermuda national football team|Bermuda]] and the [[Cayman Islands national football team|Cayman Islands]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.canadasoccer.com/news/canada-soccer-announces-mens-national-team-roster-for-fifa-world-cup-qatar-2022-qualifiers/|date=23 March 2021|title=Canada Soccer Announces Men's National Team Roster for FIFA World Cup Qatar 2022 Qualidiers|work=[[Canadian Soccer Association]]}}</ref> This new cycle was far more successful than any he had seen before, and they reached the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – CONCACAF third round|final stage]] for the first time in a quarter century.

After he suffered a bone bruise that scuppered the beginning of his club season in the fall of 2022, there was doubt as to whether Hutchinson would be ready to participate in the World Cup.<ref name=TSN221101>{{cite web |url=https://www.tsn.ca/2022-fifa-world-cup-appearance-a-crowning-achievement-in-hutchinson-s-storied-career-1.1871529|first1=Matthew|last1=Scianitti|date=1 November 2022|website=[[The Sports Network|TSN]]|title=Qatar appearance a crowning achievement in Hutchinson's storied career}}</ref> Herdman said it was "a tough situation for him.
