'''Kasper Peter Schmeichel''' (born 5 November 1986) is a Danish professional [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for {{French football updater|Nice}} club [[OGC Nice|Nice]] and the [[Denmark national football team|Denmark national team]].

Schmeichel began his career with [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]], but had loan spells with [[Darlington F.C.|Darlington]], [[Bury F.C.|Bury]] and [[Falkirk F.C.|Falkirk]] before he made his first-team debut. Although Schmeichel appeared to have made the City number 1 shirt his own at the start of the 2007–08 season, the emergence of [[Joe Hart]] resulted in Schmeichel being loaned to [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]]. The signing of Republic of Ireland international [[Shay Given]] in 2009 meant that Schmeichel fell even further down the pecking order at City, and he was allowed to link up with former manager [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] at [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]]. He spent only one season with the Magpies as, while it was a very successful one for the club and the player himself, changes to the club's financial position made his departure necessary and his contract was terminated by mutual consent.

Schmeichel joined [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] in 2010, but again, his tenure at the club would only last one season before he was the subject of a transfer to [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], where he would again work under Eriksson. Schmeichel went on to make 479 competitive appearances for Leicester over 11 years, during the most successful era in the club's history, winning the [[EFL Championship|Championship]] in the 2013–14 season, the [[Premier League]] in 2015–16, [[FA Cup]] in 2020–21 and the [[FA Community Shield]] in 2021.

Schmeichel played seventeen games for [[Denmark national under-21 football team|Denmark under-21s]]. He was called up to the Denmark national team for the first time in 2011, and was part of their squad at [[UEFA Euro 2012]], but did not make his senior debut until 2013. He represented his country at the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], [[UEFA Euro 2020]] and [[2022 FIFA World Cup]].

==Early life==
===Formative years and education===
Kasper Schmeichel was born on 5 November 1986 in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark.<ref>{{cite book |editor-first=Barry J. |editor-last=Hugman |title=The PFA Footballers' Who's Who 2010–11 |year=2010 |publisher=Mainstream Publishing |location=Edinburgh |isbn=978-1-84596-601-0 |page=370}}</ref> He is the son of Bente and former [[Denmark national football team|Denmark international]] goalkeeper [[Peter Schmeichel]], and is of Polish descent through his paternal grandfather.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Włodarczyk |first1=Tomasz |title=Schmeichel: Jest we mnie trochę z Polaka, ale stałem się Duńczykiem |url=https://www.polsatsport.pl/wiadomosc/2019-11-11/schmeichel-jest-we-mnie-troche-z-polaka-ale-stalem-sie-dunczykiem/ |access-date=22 November 2022 |work=polsatsport.pl |date=11 November 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221120152309/https://www.polsatsport.pl/wiadomosc/2019-11-11/schmeichel-jest-we-mnie-troche-z-polaka-ale-stalem-sie-dunczykiem/ |archive-date=20 November 2022 |language=pl}}</ref> 

Schmeichel grew up in Denmark during his early years but spent most of his childhood living in England due to his father's playing career. Kasper is a [[first language|native speaker]] of both Danish and English, the latter of which he speaks with a [[English language in Northern England|Northern-English]] accent. He attended [[Hulme Hall Grammar School]] in Cheadle Hulme, Stockport, Greater Manchester, and he also attended [[Saint Julian's School]] in Portugal while his father played for [[Sporting CP]] in [[Lisbon]]. When [[Alex Bruce (footballer, born 1984)|Alex Bruce]], son of Kasper's father's former Manchester United teammate [[Steve Bruce]], joined Kasper at Leeds United, the move saw the two players re-unite after both had previously played football together on the streets as children after school.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11661/10051949/goals-on-sunday-young-kasper-schmeichel-tom-ince-and-alex-bruce-play-football|title=Goals on Sunday: Young Kasper Schmeichel, Tom Ince and Alex Bruce play football|website=Sky Sports |date=1 November 2015|access-date=5 March 2020}}</ref>

===Youth-team career===
Schmeichel started playing organised football in Portugal in 2000, while his father was part of [[Sporting CP]]. He played one season in the [[G.D. Estoril Praia|Estoril]] youth academy, in which he managed to win a championship.<ref name="tipsbladet1">{{cite news |last1=Davidsen |first1=Martin |title=Kasper Schmeichels portugisiske fortid: Her begyndte målmandslivet |url=https://www.tipsbladet.dk/nyhed/landshold/kasper-schmeichels-portugisiske-fortid-her-begyndte-maalmandslivet |access-date=22 November 2022 |work=Tipsbladet |date=6 October 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128192436/http://tipsbladet.dk/nyhed/landshold/kasper-schmeichels-portugisiske-fortid-her-begyndte-maalmandslivet |archive-date=28 January 2016 |language=da}}</ref> Commenting on his early footballing years, Schmeichel remarked: "Before [Estoril], it wasn't that serious. I have to admit that when I was very small, football did not interest me that much. It was mostly in short periods that it was fun, and then I had enough. So it only started to take shape when I was 12-13 years old".<ref name="tipsbladet1" />

In 2001, Schmeichel moved to Denmark where he attended Oure Efterskole, an ''[[efterskole]]'' or voluntary independent residential school for young people finishing their [[primary education]].<ref name="oure" /> Schmeichel said in an interview with ''[[Euroman]]'' in 2014: "At Oure, I was part of an environment and met a coach who made me want to develop even more as a goalkeeper".<ref name="euroman">{{cite web |last1=Steenbach |first1=Kasper |title=Danmarks landshold: Kasper Schmeichel |url=https://www.euroman.dk/sport/kasper-schmeichel- |website=Euroman |access-date=22 November 2022 |language=da |date=22 September 2014}}</ref> Schmeichel, at the time, was described as hard-working and dedicated by coach Bo Pedersen.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Lyngholm |first1=Johan |title=Teenageåret der ændrede Kasper Schmeichels liv: Sådan blev diamanten slebet |url=https://www.bt.dk/fodbold/teenageaaret-der-aendrede-kasper-schmeichels-liv-saadan-blev-diamanten-slebet |access-date=22 November 2022 |work=B.T. |date=21 February 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221122133101/https://www.bt.dk/fodbold/teenageaaret-der-aendrede-kasper-schmeichels-liv-saadan-blev-diamanten-slebet |archive-date=22 November 2022 |language=da}}</ref> While enrolled at Oure, Schmeichel trialled with [[Brøndby IF]],<ref name="Gloved">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JYJAQvzpG4|publisher=[[YouTube]]|work=Gloved|date=23 May 2019|access-date=23 May 2019|title=Gloved – EP4 – Kasper Schmeichel}}</ref> but would instead move to [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] after another successful trial.<ref name="Gloved" />

Towards the end of the loan spell, Schmeichel requested that he would be allowed to stay on at Cardiff for a longer period and on 22 November, the loan spell was extended until the new year, with manager [[Sven-Göran Eriksson]] stating that he could possibly stay at the club for the rest of the season providing Manchester City do not suffer an injury crisis.<ref>{{cite news |title=Kasper can stay at Ninian into the new year |url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/kasper-can-stay-ninian-new-2219786 |website=WalesOnline |publisher=Media Wales |date=22 November 2007 |access-date=3 December 2013}}</ref> After Eriksson named [[Joe Hart]] as the number one goalkeeper at Manchester City, however, [[Andreas Isaksson]] requested a transfer.

===Notts County===
On 14 August 2009, Schmeichel signed for League Two side [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] in a deal that is believed to have broken the club's previous transfer record.

===Leicester City===
====2011–12 season====
[[File:Schmeichel vs Chelsea.jpg|thumb|200px|Schmeichel playing for [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] in 2012]]
On 27 June 2011, Schmeichel was officially confirmed as a Leicester player, signing a three-year deal for an undisclosed fee that reunited him for a second time with his former Manchester City and Notts County manager, Sven-Göran Eriksson.

In the first month of the season, Schmeichel was shown a seemingly needless red card in the 79th minute of Leicester's away game to [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] on 20 August 2011 after receiving two yellow cards for "unsporting conduct". He received the first card for moving the ball from the penalty spot as Forest's [[Lewis McGugan]] was about to take a kick, then received his second for throwing the ball away after the spot kick was successfully converted. After the match, Schmeichel apologized, claiming his back was turned to the referee so did not know he had received the first of the yellow cards. "I didn't know I had been booked as I had my back to the ref otherwise I would never have done that," he said on his personal [[Twitter]] page.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/eng_div_1/14514759.stm Nottingham Forest v Leicester City match report.] BBC Sport.

Schmeichel played a total of 52 games overall, making 17 clean sheets and saving four penalties. His performances in the [[2011–12 Leicester City F.C. season|2011–12 season]] earned him the club's Player of the Year and Players' Player of the Year awards on 30 April.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0,,10274~2755427,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120805050551/http://www.lcfc.com/page/LatestNews/0%2C%2C10274~2755427%2C00.html |archive-date=5 August 2012 |title=Schmeichel Crowned Player of the Year |publisher=Leicester City F.C. |date=30 April 2012 |access-date=3 December 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

====2012–13 season====
Schmeichel's form in the first half of the [[2012–13 Leicester City F.C. season|2012–13 season]] surpassed that of the previous season, keeping 12 clean sheets in 28 games, the most in the league as the Foxes sat second in the table, such performances earning him links with [[La Liga]] giants [[Real Madrid C.F|Real Madrid]] and also leading to his first senior [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] cap. A particular highlight was a spectacular save against [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] in February. On 16 April 2013, he made his 100th Leicester appearance in a 3–2 win over [[Bolton Wanderers F.C.|Bolton Wanderers]]. Schmeichel's performances earned him a place in the 2012–13 Championship PFA Team of the Year, alongside club captain [[Wes Morgan]].

====2013–14 season====
During the [[2013–14 Football League Championship|2013–14 season]], Schmeichel kept nine clean sheets during a 19-game unbeaten run spanning from December to April to help guarantee Leicester promotion from the Championship with six games to spare. Schmeichel's high quality performances once again led to him being courted by some of world football's giants, with both Manchester United and [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] being linked with moves for the Danish international during the January transfer window.

In March, TV footage<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.101greatgoals.com/blog/leicester-keeper-kasper-schmeichel-should-have-been-awarded-injury-time-goal-v-yeovil-header-crossed-the-line-vine/ |date=25 March 2014 |title=Leicester keeper Kasper Schmeichel scores injury time header Yeovil!

At the end of the [[2013–14 Leicester City F.C. season|2013–14 season]], it was announced that Schmeichel had signed a four-year contract extension until the summer of 2018 with Leicester.<ref name="contract">{{cite web |title=Schmeichel Signs New Leicester City Deal |url=https://www.lcfc.com/news/article/040614-schmeichel-signs-new-leicester-city-deal-1602227.aspx |publisher=Leicester City F.C. |access-date=4 June 2014}}</ref>
