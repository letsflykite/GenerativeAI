"'''Three Lions'''", commonly referred to as "'''It's Coming Home'''" or "'''Football's Coming Home'''", is a song by the English comedians [[David Baddiel]] and [[Frank Skinner]] and the rock band the [[The Lightning Seeds|Lightning Seeds]].<ref>{{cite web | url=https://theathletic.com/3446875/2022/07/26/its-coming-home-england-fans-euro-2022/ | title='It's coming home' - perfect for England fans or is it time for a change? }}</ref> It was released on 20 May 1996 to mark the [[England national football team|England football team's]] participation in [[UEFA Euro 1996|that year's]] [[UEFA European Championship]], which England was hosting.

The music was written by the Lightning Seeds singer [[Ian Broudie]], while Baddiel and Skinner—presenters of the football comedy show ''[[Fantasy Football League]]''—provided the lyrics. All three provided vocals. The title comes from the England team emblem.

Both the original version of "Three Lions" and the updated "Three Lions '98" reached number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]], becoming one of only three songs to top the British charts more than once with lyric variants; the others are "[[Mambo No. 5]]" (in versions by [[Lou Bega]] and [[Bob the Builder]]) and "[[Do They Know It's Christmas?]]" (by [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]], [[Band Aid 20]] and [[Band Aid 30]]). It regularly reappears in the UK singles chart around major football tournaments involving the England team.

The song has been described as the ''de facto'' "anthem" of English football since 1996.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/its-coming-home-english-soccer-anthem-explained-1013485|title=What does "Football's coming home" mean to English fans?|date=9 July 2018|work=Newsweek|access-date=11 July 2018|language=en}}</ref> Its chorus, with the refrain "It's coming home", has become a popular [[Football chant|chant]] for fans at England games.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/soccer/news/world-cup-2018-what-does-its-coming-home-mean-lyrics-song-england-soccer-three-lions/11npkw6z2ile21e6isr1t618f4|title=World Cup 2018: Why English soccer fans chant 'It's coming home'|date=11 July 2018|work=Sporting News|access-date=11 July 2018}}</ref>

==Writing==
The [[The Football Association|Football Association]] (FA) asked Lightning Seeds songwriter Ian Broudie to compose a song for the [[UEFA Euro 1996|1996 UEFA European Football Championship]].<ref name=":0" /> He composed a melody he felt would make a good [[football chant]], and asked the comedians Frank Skinner and David Baddiel, presenters of the football comedy show ''Fantasy Football League'', to write the lyric.<ref name=":0" /><ref>Frank Skinner, "[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/frank_skinner/article6337437.ece Don't blame a slogan for football's failures]", in ''[[The Times]]'', 22 May 2009</ref> Broudie refused the FA's offer to have football players sing on the song, saying he did not want it to be "England-istic" or nationalistic. He said it was more about "being a football fan, which, for 90% of the time, is losing".<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|date=7 June 2021|title=How we made 'Three Lions': David Baddiel and Ian Broudie on England's Euro 96 anthem|url=http://www.theguardian.com/music/2021/jun/07/how-we-made-three-lions-david-baddiel-ian-broudie-england-euro-96-anthem-footballers|access-date=3 July 2021|website=[[The Guardian]]|language=en}}</ref>

According to Skinner's autobiography, the original lyric included the line "Butcher ready for war" instead of "Bobby belting the ball". The line was a reference to a notorious World Cup qualifier against Sweden in 1989, when the defender [[Terry Butcher]] played despite his head bleeding profusely for much of the match.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Skinner|first=Frank|url=https://archive.org/details/frankskinner0000skin/page/136/mode/2up|title=Frank Skinner|publisher=Century|year=2001|isbn=9780712679275|pages=137}}</ref> Baddiel later revealed a handwritten copy of the lyrics on Twitter with "Terry Butcher at war" shown as the replaced lyric.<ref>{{cite web|author=David Baddiel|date=20 May 2021|title=It being 25 years since Three Lions was first released, Frank just sent me this pic of this piece of paper.

The "ready for war" motif was later used in the 1998 version of the song, attributed to [[Paul Ince]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2021}}

The crowd noise in the intro of the track is in fact [[Brøndby IF|Brøndby]] fans recorded by Ian Broudie at [[Anfield]] during a [[1995–96 UEFA Cup|UEFA Cup]] tie in October 1995.<ref>{{cite news|title=World Cup 2018: Three Lions on course to top UK singles chart|work=BBC News|date=9 July 2018|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-44764277|access-date=10 July 2018}}</ref>

==Themes==
The song title refers to the three lions on the England team crest.<ref name=":0" /> The chorus lyric, "it's coming home", reflected the fact that the Euro 96 competition was the first football competition England had hosted since the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] but has evolved to include the concept of the cup returning to the [[Football#Establishment of modern codes|homeland of the sport]].<ref name=":0" /> The song makes references to several players, [[Bobby Moore]], [[Bobby Charlton]], [[Nobby Stiles]] and [[Gordon Banks]], who played in the 1966 World Cup winning team.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/newsround/44736620|title=It's Coming Home: What does the England football song mean? - CBBC Newsround|newspaper=BBC Newsround |date=6 July 2018 |via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>

Among the references in the song are:
*"That tackle by Moore": Bobby Moore's tackle of [[Jairzinho]] in a [[1970 FIFA World Cup Group 3#Brazil vs England|group match]] against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at the [[1970 FIFA World Cup]].<ref name="mcdonald">{{cite web |last1=McDonald |first1=Karl |title=Three Lions lyrics: 'It's coming home', words and meaning of England's favourite football song |url=https://inews.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/three-lions-lyrics-meaning-england-football-its-coming-home-explained-173050 |website=[[i (newspaper)|iNews]] |access-date=24 October 2021 |date=11 July 2021}}</ref>

*"Nobby dancing": Nobby Stiles dancing with the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy#Jules Rimet Trophy|Jules Rimet Trophy]] after England won the 1966 FIFA World Cup.<ref name="mcdonald"/>

Unlike those of most football songs, the lyrics speak not of unbounded optimism for victory but instead of how, since England's victory in the 1966 FIFA World Cup, every tournament has ended in dashed hopes.<ref name=":1">{{cite news|last=Mathure |first=Varun |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/song-for-euro-96-ready-for-airplay-1347815.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220507/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/song-for-euro-96-ready-for-airplay-1347815.html |archive-date=7 May 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live |title=Song for Euro 96 ready for airplay - Sport |newspaper=The Independent |date=17 May 1996 |access-date=22 November 2012}}{{cbignore}}</ref> However, the failures have not dampened the feeling that England could succeed again ("Three lions on a shirt / [[Jules Rimet Trophy|Jules Rimet]] still gleaming / Thirty years of hurt / never stopped me dreaming").<ref>Mark Edwards [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6626127.ece Duckworth Lewis Method's songs about sport]" in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', 5 July 2009</ref> Baddiel said the song was "really about [[magical thinking]]. About assuming we are going to lose, reasonably, based on experience, but hoping that somehow we won't."<ref name=":0" />

Despite the failures of the past, each tournament is greeted with fresh hopes that this might be the year they do it again: "I know that was then, but it could be again", and the song's chorus proclaimed that "It's coming home, it's coming home, it's coming, football's coming home" which refers, like the tournament's slogan, "Football comes home", to the invention of the modern game in England.<ref>{{cite web|author=Dave Simpson |url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/jun/11/ian-broudie-lightning-seeds-three-lions-world-cup-interview |title=The Lightning Seeds' Ian Broudie: 'People didn't know what was on the England badge before Three Lions' &#124; Music |work=The Guardian|date=11 June 2014 |access-date=16 March 2015}}</ref> Following England's success at the [[UEFA Women's Euro 2022|2022 Women's Euro]], Baddiel said: "I'm very happy to think the song would, in a way, be put to bed."<ref>{{Cite web |date=1 August 2022 |title=Three Lions anthem could be 'put to bed' after Euro 2022 win, says David Baddiel |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/aug/01/time-to-retire-three-lions-anthem-after-euro-2022-win-says-david-baddiel |access-date=1 August 2022 |website=[[The Guardian]] |language=en}}</ref>

== Music video ==
Pedro Romhanyi directed the [[music video]] for the original ''Three Lions''.<ref name=":1" /><ref>{{Cite web|title=Pedro Romhanyi|url=https://www2.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2bb0adcc17|url-status=live|access-date=9 July 2021|website=[[British Film Institute]]|language=en}}</ref> Romhanyi said that while Skinner and Baddiel are comedians, they took the recording seriously, as "this is not about making a pop video; it's about doing something that's good for football."<ref name=":1" /> Baddiel recalled that Romhanyi insisted that the music video feel "homely", opening with Skinner and Baddiel making tea while watching television at home.<ref name="Rachel2019">{{cite book|last=Rachel|first=Daniel|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uYmGDwAAQBAJ&pg=PT223|title=Don't Look Back In Anger: The rise and fall of Cool Britannia, told by those who were there|date=5 September 2019|publisher=Orion Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-4091-8073-9|pages=223–}}</ref>

The video also features much archival footage and images of the referenced 1966 and later teams featuring for example, Bobby Moore, Nobby Stiles, and Gary Lineker. The contemporary pub scene was filmed at The Queen of the Isle in London, which was demolished in 2004. The pub scene includes a cameo appearance by 1966 team member [[Geoff Hurst]], who is the first player to score a [[hat-trick]] in a World Cup final.<ref>{{Citation |title=Three Lions (Football's Coming Home) (Official Video) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJqimlFcJsM |language=en |access-date=19 November 2022}}</ref>

==Reception==
The [[Britpop]] phenomenon was at its peak in 1996, and the Lightning Seeds were one of its leading acts, so their involvement gave the song very wide appeal. It reached number one on the singles chart, and as England progressed to the semi-finals, stadiums around the country echoed to the sound of fans singing the song after English victories over [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]], [[Netherlands national football team|the Netherlands]] and [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. It was so popular that even other teams liked it. England faced [[Germany national football team|Germany]] in the semi-finals, and [[Jürgen Klinsmann]] said later that the Germans were singing the song themselves on the way to the stadium, and the German team and the crowd sang the song as they paraded the trophy on the [[Römer]] balcony in Frankfurt. The single as a result reached number 49 on the [[GfK Entertainment charts|German Singles Chart]].<ref name="ger" /> The song was later sung by Germany fans during their team's first appearance at the new Wembley in 2007<ref>{{cite news|author=Sven Goldmann |url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/sport/prestige-duell-dfb-team-besiegt-england-in-wembley/1020222.html |title=Prestige-Duell: DFB-Team besiegt England in Wembley |newspaper=Der Tagesspiegel Online |date=22 August 2007 |publisher=DER TAGESSPIEGEL |access-date=9 July 2018}}</ref> and is still heard frequently on German radio stations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2021}} Broudie said he was shocked to hear German fans singing the song after beating England at Euro 96.<ref name=":0" />

The original version still receives regular airplay in England around the time of major international football tournaments. It has been adopted as a [[Football chant|terrace chant]] and is occasionally sung by fans at England international matches today. When it was sung by England fans at the [[FIFA World Cup 2006|2006 World Cup]] after England took the lead against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]], commentator [[John Motson]] remarked, "As football songs go, Three Lions is certainly the best".<ref>{{cite news |title=7 things you definitely didn't know about 'Three Lions' |url=https://www.irishpost.com/sport/three-lions-facts-trivia-157100 |access-date=1 July 2021 |newspaper=Irish Post}}</ref> The song has sold 1.6 million copies in the UK as of June 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/world-cup-2018-the-official-singles-chart-from-this-week-in-1998-was-packed-with-football-anthems__23149/|title=The Official Singles Chart 20 years ago this week was packed with football anthems|publisher=Official Charts Company|access-date=11 July 2018}}</ref>

England lost in a [[Penalty shootout (football)|penalty shootout]] against Germany in 1996, so the song's lyrics rang true once again. It was subsequently re-recorded with different lyrics (under the title "3 Lions '98") as an unofficial anthem for England's [[Football World Cup|World Cup]] campaign in 1998 (unlike in 1996, when it was the "official song of the England football team") and landed the number-one spot in the singles chart for a second time, beating the official England song "[[(How Does It Feel to Be) On Top of the World?]]" by England United to the top spot by eight places.

This version of the song begins with the sound of stadium crowds singing the original chorus. It then samples [[Jonathan Pearce (commentator)|Jonathan Pearce]]'s commentary of the decisive penalty miss by England's [[Gareth Southgate]] in a shoot-out with Germany, where England were eliminated at the semi-final stage. Pearce's commentary of earlier rounds of the tournament was also used later in the song.

While the 1996 "Three Lions" song drew on various memorable moments from the previous 30 years, the 1998 version reflected on the Euro 96 tournament and its entry alongside previous disappointments, as well as the team's performance in qualifying for the 1998 World Cup. The verse mentioning specific players focused this time on the then-current England squad:

* [[Paul Ince]] – "Ince ready for war" – his performance against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in a crucial qualifier for that year's World Cup
* [[Paul Gascoigne]] – "Gazza good as before" – the long-awaited return of his 1990 World Cup form in Euro 96, particularly his goal against [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]]
* [[Alan Shearer]] – "Shearer certain to score" – with five goals, he had been the top scorer of Euro 96, despite a poor run of form in internationals before the tournament
* [[Stuart Pearce]] – "And Psycho screaming" – his primal celebration after scoring a penalty in the Euro 96 quarter-final shoot-out against Spain, which lifted the burden he had felt after failing to score in the semi-final shootout at the 1990 World Cup

However, and amid much controversy, neither Gascoigne nor Pearce were selected for England's 1998 World Cup squad, which was not announced until some time after the song had been recorded.

As well as a karaoke version of the new song, the single featured a song called "Tout est Possible" (French for "Anything is Possible") as a B-side. The song was largely composed of a recurring chorus, samples from commentators and pundits, and the occasional short verse. It also started with a [[French language|French]] speech sample referring to "La Coupe du Monde" (The World Cup).

===1998 video===
There was also a completely new video made for the 1998 version of the song again directed by Pedro Romhanyi. The storyline is different as the trio are now travelling on a motor coach to France with a group of England fans for the 1998 World Cup.<ref>{{cite web |title=Baddiel & Skinner & the Lightning Seeds - 3 Lions '98 |url=http://collections-search.bfi.org.uk/web/Details/ChoiceFilmWorks/154397845 |publisher=British Film Institute |access-date=12 July 2021}}</ref> The video later portrays a match between the English fans and their German equivalents, most of whom have the name "Kuntz" printed on the back of their football shirts (except for one, who instead has "[[Jürgen Klinsmann|Klinsmann]]"). German player [[Stefan Kuntz]] had played an instrumental part in Germany's semi-final victory over England at Wembley in 1996, but his name is similar to the disparaging [[vulgarity]] "[[cunt]]s"; the segment was often cut by broadcasters. Baddiel and Skinner had previously mocked Kuntz's name on their ''Fantasy Football'' television programme.

The video also featured [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] appearances from [[Geoff Hurst]] (who also made a cameo in the music video for the original song in 1996), [[John Regis (athlete)|John Regis]], [[Robbie Williams]] and [[Chris Evans (British broadcaster)|Chris Evans]]. The archival footage was also updated.

The final scene from the video when Frank Skinner dips his arm into custard while grasping a melon, so it bears a comical resemblance to the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy|World Cup trophy]], was shown on German public TV station [[Das Erste]] a few days before the final was to be played.

=="Three Lions (Lionesses Version)"==
In summer 2022, the song was rewritten slightly as England hosted [[UEFA Women's Euro 2022]] and the [[England women's national football team|England women's team]] made the final against Germany, which they won 2–1 in extra time to win the Lionesses' first ever major trophy and England's first major trophy (men's or women's) since the 1966 World Cup. The Lightning Seeds and Baddiel performed the new version with [[Chelcee Grimes]] and retired Lionesses [[Fara Williams]], [[Rachel Yankey]], [[Faye White]], [[Rachel Brown]] and [[Anita Asante]] at the [[Electric Ballroom]] in [[London Borough of Camden|Camden]] with Skinner in attendance. This time, references were to current England women's players:<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moore |first1=Joe |title=IT'S COMING HOME: Three Lions lyrics: England anthem rewritten to support Lionesses ahead of Euro 2022 final at Wembley – 'Lionesses roar, no more need for dreaming' |url=https://talksport.com/football/1160589/three-lions-lyrics-england-rewritten-lionesses-euro-2022-final/ |publisher=talkSPORT |date=31 July 2022 |access-date=1 August 2022}}</ref>

* [[Ellen White (footballer)|Ellen White]] – "Ellen White standing tall" – she scored two goals at the tournament, having already become England's all-time female leading goalscorer before the tournament.
* [[Alessia Russo]] – "Russo's ready to score" – she scored four goals in the tournament, including a backheel goal in the semi-final against [[Sweden women's national football team|Sweden]] at [[Bramall Lane]] that went between Swedish goalkeeper [[Hedvig Lindahl]]'s legs and became a [[FIFA Puskás Award]] nominee.
* [[Georgia Stanway]] – "Stanway kicking the ball" – she scored the winning goal in the quarter-final against [[Spain women's national football team|Spain]] at [[Falmer Stadium]] in extra time with a shot from outside the box.
* [[Beth Mead]] – "And Beth Mead screaming" – she was named both player of the tournament and top scorer with six goals and five assists.

Two other verses were added: ''"Now is the time, the Lionesses can shine…"'' and ''"Lionesses roar, a squad we can believe in / This England team has soared, no more need for dreaming."''

==Re-issues==
"3 Lions '98" was re-released for the World Cup in 2002, and again on 5 June 2006 for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|World Cup 2006]] in Germany. It charted at number nine on the [[UK Singles Chart]] in 2006. The 2006 re-release was a [[DualDisc]] version with both the original version of "Three Lions" and "3 Lions '98" on the CD side and the [[music video]]s for the two songs on the DVD side. In 2021, Sony re-issued the two versions on a seven-inch vinyl as "3 Lions: Football's Coming Home - 25th Anniversary Edition", with "Three Lions" on one side listed as The First Half (rather than the A-side) and "3 Lions '98" on the other side, listed as The Second Half (rather than the B-side or double A-side).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://superdeluxeedition.com/news/out-this-week-on-4-june-2021/|title=Out This Week / on 4 June 2021 – SuperDeluxeEdition}}</ref>

In autumn of 1996, [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] opposition leader [[Tony Blair]] addressed his party's conference with the quote "Seventeen years of hurt, never stopped us dreaming, Labour's coming home", a play on words from the song's chorus and in reference to his confidence that Labour would return to power at the [[1997 United Kingdom general election|forthcoming general election]], having been in the opposition since the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] ousted them from government in [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]].

In summer 2018, the song enjoyed a renaissance due to the England national team's performance in the [[2018 FIFA World Cup]], in which they reached the semi-finals, and this caused the song to reach number one on the UK Singles Chart. After [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] eliminated England in the World Cup semi-final, Croatia's captain [[Luka Modrić]] said that his team had taken the song's refrain as disrespect which had additionally motivated them to win the match.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/croatia-vs-england-uefa-nations-league-what-time-where-live-stream-gareth-southgate-its-coming-home-a8580126.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220621/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/croatia-vs-england-uefa-nations-league-what-time-where-live-stream-gareth-southgate-its-coming-home-a8580126.html |archive-date=21 June 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Croatia missed the English humour in 'It's Coming Home' mantra during World Cup run, insists Gareth Southgate|author=Mark Mann-Bryans | work=Independent | date=12 October 2018}}</ref> In response, England manager [[Gareth Southgate]] among others stated the Croats misunderstand [[British humour|English humour]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/croatia-vs-england-uefa-nations-league-what-time-where-live-stream-gareth-southgate-its-coming-home-world-cup-a8580126.html |archive-url=https://ghostarchive.org/archive/20220621/https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/international/croatia-vs-england-uefa-nations-league-what-time-where-live-stream-gareth-southgate-its-coming-home-world-cup-a8580126.html |archive-date=21 June 2022 |url-access=subscription |url-status=live|title=Croatia missed the English humour in 'It's Coming Home' mantra, insists Gareth Southgate|date=12 October 2018|website=The Independent}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.balls.ie/football/lineker-its-comming-home-392784|title=Lineker Defends &quot;It's Coming Home&quot; And Neville Hits Out At &quot;Disrespectful&quot; Suker In Row Over English Arrogance|first=Gavin|last=Cooney|website=Balls.ie}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/football/2018/jul/17/its-not-coming-home-englands-anthem-returns-to-haunt-them|title='It's not coming home': England's anthem returns to haunt them|date=17 July 2018|website=The Guardian}}</ref>
