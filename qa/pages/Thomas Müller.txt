==Style of play==
Müller's role can be described as an attacking all-rounder,<ref name="rafaSI" /> a versatile player who is able to play in a variety of offensive positions. As he came through the youth system, he was seen primarily as a [[midfielder]],<ref name="champions1210" /> but since breaking into the first-team he has been used in more attacking roles. Bayern Munich usually plays a [[Formation (association football)#4.E2.80.932.E2.80.933.E2.80.931|4–2–3–1]] formation, and Müller is most often part of the three attacking midfielders behind the central [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]].
