A youth product of [[CA Osasuna|Osasuna]], Azpilicueta spent three seasons in [[La Liga]] before switching to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]], winning four major honours with the French club. In the summer of 2012, he moved to [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], winning the [[2013 UEFA Europa League final|Europa League]] in his first season and a domestic [[Double (association football)|double]] [[2014–15 Chelsea F.C. season|two years later]]. He made over 500 appearances for Chelsea and is currently sixth on their [[List of Chelsea F.C. records and statistics#Most appearances|list of all-time appearances]]; no other non-English person has played more times for the club. He captained Chelsea to win the Europa League in [[2019 UEFA Europa League final|2019]], the [[UEFA Champions League|Champions League]] in [[2021 UEFA Champions League final|2021]], and the [[FIFA Club World Cup]] in [[2021 FIFA Club World Cup final|2021]]. 

Azpilicueta earned 55 [[Cap (sport)|caps]] for [[Spain national youth football team|Spain at youth level]] in all age groups, and represented the [[Spain national under-21 football team|under-21s]] in two [[UEFA European Under-21 Championship|European Championships]], [[2011 UEFA European Under-21 Championship|winning the 2011 edition]]. He made his first appearance with [[Spain national football team|the full side]] in 2013 and was selected for three [[FIFA World Cup|World Cups]] as well as [[UEFA Euro 2016|Euro 2016]] and [[UEFA Euro 2020]].

==Club career==
===Osasuna===
A product of hometown club [[CA Osasuna]]'s [[CA Osasuna Juvenil|youth system]], he made his [[La Liga]] debut on 8 April 2007 in a 0–2 away loss against [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], while still registered with [[CA Osasuna B|the reserve team]];<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.espnfc.com/report/_/id/204057?cc=5739 |title=Real Madrid 2–0 Osasuna |website=ESPN Soccernet |date=8 April 2007|access-date=24 August 2012}}</ref> he started his career as a [[Forward (association football)|forward]] then switched to [[midfielder]]<ref>{{cite web |url=http://trolacas.wordpress.com/2009/02/20/cesar-azpilicueta-intentad-atacar-por-la-otra-banda/ |title=César Azpilicueta, intentad atacar por la otra banda|trans-title=César Azpilicueta, try the other wing |publisher=El Blog de los Trolacas |language=es |date=20 February 2009|access-date=24 August 2012}}</ref> and, throughout both his club and international career (senior and youth), appeared in several positions, including [[centre-back]] and [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.ideal.es/granada/deportes/futbol/seleccion-espanola/201411/12/azpilicueta-nuevo-seguro-bosque-20141112195750-rc.html |title=Azpilicueta, el nuevo 'seguro' de Del Bosque|trans-title=Azpilicueta, Del Bosque's new 'insurance' |newspaper=[[Ideal (newspaper)|Ideal]] |language=es |date=12 November 2014|access-date=20 October 2015}}</ref>

In [[2007–08 La Liga|2007–08]], due to injuries in the main squad, Azpilicueta established himself as a first-team regular at the age of just 18, albeit as a [[right-back]]. He went on to retain this position for [[2008–09 La Liga|the following season]], appearing in all but two league games.

===Marseille===

On 27 November 2010, in the early minutes of a 4–0 home win against [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]] – which meant Marseille [[2010–11 Ligue 1|climbed to the top of the league]] – Azpilicueta ruptured the [[anterior cruciate ligament]]s in his left knee.<ref>[https://int.soccerway.com/news/2010/November/28/marseille-go-top-but-pay-high-price/ Marseille go top but pay high price] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129014337/http://www.soccerway.com/news/2010/November/28/marseille-go-top-but-pay-high-price/|date=29 November 2010}}; Soccerway, 27 November 2010</ref> He was sidelined for six months.

In August 2012, amid speculation of clubs showing interest in Azpilicueta, including [[Premier League]] club [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]], Marseille confirmed that he could leave, saying, "If Chelsea makes a fair offer for Azpi [Azpilicueta], we will let him leave."<ref>[http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/11668/7988728/Marseille-confirm-need-to-sell Marseille confirm need to sell]; [[Sky Sports]], 14 August 2012</ref> Despite his loyalty to Marseille, the player said he was willing to leave if his "departure can help Marseille's finances".<ref>[http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/12691/8007076/Azpilicueta-open-to-Blues-move Azpilicueta open to Blues move]; Sky Sports, 21 August 2012</ref>
