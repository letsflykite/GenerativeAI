Sequeira made his senior debut for Real Unión on 29 October 2017, in a 3–0 [[Segunda División B]] away loss against [[CD Tudelano]]. On 16 July 2019, after acting mainly as a backup, he signed a permanent two-year contract.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://realunionclub.com/post/patrick-sequiera-ficha-por-dos-a%C3%B1os|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200920193405/https://realunionclub.com/post/patrick-sequiera-ficha-por-dos-a%C3%B1os|title=Patrick Sequiera ficha por dos años|trans-title=Patrick Sequeira signs for two years|publisher=Real Unión|language=es|date=16 July 2019|archivedate=20 September 2020|accessdate=14 August 2022}}</ref>

On 8 September 2020, Sequeira moved to [[RC Celta de Vigo]] on loan for one year, being initially assigned to [[Celta de Vigo B|the reserves]] in [[Segunda División B]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://rccelta.es/gl/fundacion/actualidad/patrick-sequeira-reforza-a-porteria-do-celta-b/|title=Patrick Sequeira reforza a portería do Celta B|trans-title=Patrick Sequeira bolsters the goal of Celta B|publisher=Celta Vigo|language=es|date=8 September 2020|accessdate=14 August 2022}}</ref> Upon returning, he featured rarely for Real Unión in [[Primera División RFEF]].

On 4 July 2022, Sequeira agreed to a three-year deal with [[Segunda División]] side [[CD Lugo]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdlugo.com/noticia/patrick-sequeira-nuevo-jugador-del-cd-lugo|title=Patrick Sequeira, nuevo jugador del CD Lugo|trans-title=Patrick Sequeira, new player of CD Lugo|publisher=CD Lugo|language=es|date=4 July 2022|accessdate=14 August 2022}}</ref>

== International career ==
Sequeira was part of the squad at the [[2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], but did not play any match. Originally set to make his debut in a group stage match against [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]], he suffered an ankle injury moments before the match and was replaced by [[Leonel Moreira]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Mendoza |first1=Adrián |title=Patrick Sequeira se lesiona de última hora y no jugará contra Jamaica {{!}} Crhoy.com |url=https://www.crhoy.com/deportes/patrick-sequeira-se-lesiona-de-ultima-hora-y-no-jugara-contra-jamaica/ |access-date=7 November 2021 |work=CRHoy.com {{!}} Periodico Digital {{!}} Costa Rica Noticias 24/7 |date=20 July 2021 |language=es}}</ref>

His debut came during a friendly match against [[South Korea national football team|South Korea]] in November 2022, when Sequeira came in as a substitute for [[Joel Campbell]] as [[Esteban Alvarado]] received a red card. Sequeira's first instant of action as a goalkeeper for Costa Rica was also his first goal conceded, as Alvarado's red card also meant a close free kick eventually scored by [[Son Heung-min]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Vargas |first1=Dinia |title=Minuto 80: Expulsado Esteban Alvarado y gol de Corea {{!}} Crhoy.com |url=https://www.crhoy.com/deportes/minuto-80-expulsado-esteban-alvarado-y-gol-de-corea/ |access-date=25 September 2022 |work=CRHoy.com {{!}} Periodico Digital {{!}} Costa Rica Noticias 24/7 |date=23 September 2022 |language=es}}</ref>
