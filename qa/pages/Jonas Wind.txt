==Career==

===Early career===
Wind began his career in [[Avedøre IF]] in 2007 and moved to Rosenhøj Boldklub in 2010, where he was named youth player of the year in 2011. At only twelve years old, he was the youngest player ever to receive this honour.

Wind played 12 games for Denmark's U17 national team and three matches for the U18 national team. He scored eight goals in nine matches for the U19 national team. In March 2019, he had his two first matches in the U21 national team, scoring in the second against Belgium in the 90th minute.

===FC Copenhagen===
In July 2012, Wind was admitted to the FCK School of Excellence. He played for the club's U17, U18 and U19 teams until 2018. Here, he scored nine goals for U17 in the 2014/15 season, became top scorer in the U17 league and for FCK's U17 team in 2015–16 with 28 goals in 24 games. He was the third-highest scoring player in the U19 league in 2016–17.

Wind signed a contract for the senior team with FC Copenhagen on his nineteenth birthday on 7 February 2018, and debuted at Wanda Metropolitano against Atletico Madrid on 22 February. He scored his first senior goal in FC Copenhagen's 2–1 Superliga win against AaB on 18 April. On 26 April 2018, Wind was awarded Kjøbenhavns Boldklub's youth talent award 'Granen'.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fck.dk/nyhed/jonas-wind-aarets-kb-talent-et-stort-skulderklap|title=Jonas Wind årets KB-talent: Et stort skulderklap|website=F.C. København|language=da|access-date=18 April 2019}}</ref>

On 4 November 2018, Wind secured a derby victory over rivals [[Brøndby IF]] when he first-timed a [[Robert Skov]] cross in goal during [[Overtime (sports)#Association football|overtime]].<ref>{{Citation|title=Highlights: Brøndby 0-1 FCK|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzw71jWBa_c|language=en|access-date=7 August 2019}}</ref>

Wind kicked off the 2019–20 Superliga season in fine fashion with goals in the first three games against [[Odense Boldklub|OB]], [[Aarhus Gymnastikforening|AGF]], and [[AC Horsens]].

On 6 August 2019, Wind scored a [[Panenka (penalty kick)|Panenka]] penalty kick in the exact same stadium as the original [[Antonín Panenka|Panenka]] forcing the goalkeeper to his right and chipping the ball in high in the middle of the goal. This sealed the match result to a 1–1 draw between [[Red Star Belgrade]] and Copenhagen in the first leg of the third qualifying round to the [[2019–20 UEFA Champions League]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fck.dk/en/news/jonas-wind-wacth-panenka-penalty-vs-red-star-belgrade|title=Jonas Wind: WACTH Panenka penalty vs Red Star Belgrade|website=F.C.
