The '''2022 FIFA World Cup qualifying match between Canada and Mexico''' was an [[association football]] match contested by the [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canadian]] and [[Mexico men's national football team|Mexican]] men's national soccer teams during the [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – CONCACAF third round|third round]] of [[CONCACAF]]'s [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification|2022 FIFA World Cup qualification tournament]]. Canada's victory over Mexico ended Mexico's eleven match unbeaten streak against Canada dating back to August 15, 2000, and put Canada in first place of the qualifying group.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/sports/soccer/analysis/2021/11/17/it-was-a-bit-of-a-tactical-battle-how-canada-upset-mexico-and-climbed-to-the-top-in-world-cup-qualifying.html|title='It was a bit of a tactical battle.'

==Pre-match==
===Venue selection===
Canada was scheduled to be the home team for the seventh and eighth fixtures of the qualifying group, and the [[Canadian Soccer Association]] chose to host their matches in [[Edmonton, Alberta]], a city renowned for very cold [[Canadian Prairies|Prairie]] winters. This strategy was often used by both Canada and the [[United States Soccer Federation|United States]] to create a disadvantage for the Mexican team, as those players would not be used to playing under such frigid conditions.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/soc-canada-mexico-weather-edmonton-1.6250703|title=Home field advantage?

===Background===
Canada and Mexico had faced each other twice before in 2021. Mexico was able to beat Canada [[2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup knockout stage#Mexico vs Canada|2–1]] in the [[2021 CONCACAF Gold Cup]] semi-finals, defeating them with a winning goal in the 90+9th minute of the match scored by [[Héctor Herrera]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.concacaf.com/en/gold-cup/game-details?matchid=568667|title=FINAL ROUND - SEMI-FINAL <nowiki>|</nowiki> SEMI-FINAL 2|date=March 11, 2021 |publisher=concacaf.com|access-date=September 7, 2022}}</ref> Mexico had also hosted Canada earlier in October for a World Cup qualifying match which ended in a [[2022 FIFA World Cup qualification – CONCACAF third round#Mexico v Canada|1–1]] draw at the Estadio Azteca. Mexico were in second place of the group, tied with first place U.S. with fourteen points, while Canada trailed by one point in third place. Both teams had the opportunity to rise to the top of the group if they could come away with a win.

===Summary===
====First half====
The first half quickly became a hostile affair, with both sides carrying over the bitterness from the recent fixtures. A particularly hard challenge in the first couple minutes of play left Mexican forward [[Hirving Lozano]] down for several minutes as the foul count continued to grow. As tensions rose, both managers were cautioned after half an hour for complaints towards the referees and each other.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/soccer/article-larin-scores-twice-to-lift-canada-to-2-1-win-over-mexico-and-into-top/|title=Canada beats Mexico 2-1, securing key win in quest for World Cup berth|author=Sandor, Steven|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=November 16, 2021|access-date=October 9, 2022}}</ref> Canada were able to find the opening goal in first-half stoppage time after [[Cyle Larin]] was able to tap in a rebound after goalkeeper [[Guillermo Ochoa]] mistakenly fumbled the ball from a long shot by [[Alistair Johnston]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/recap-canada-2-mexico-1|title=Recap: Canada 2, Mexico 1|author=Singh, Michael|publisher=mlssoccer.com|date=November 19, 2021|access-date=October 9, 2022}}</ref>

====Second half====
Seven minutes into the second half, Canada would double their lead when Mexico failed to defend a [[Stephen Eustáquio]] free kick which landed in the [[goal area]] for Larin to tap in. During the goal celebration, Canadian defender [[Sam Adekugbe]] made headlines after celebrating in true Canadian fashion by jumping into a snow bank which had developed near the corner of the pitch. This goal was Larin's twenty-second goal for the Canada men's national team, and equaled the team's top scoring record held by [[Dwayne De Rosario]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/sports/soccer/article-larin-scores-twice-to-lift-canada-to-2-1-win-over-mexico-and-into-top/|title=Canada beats Mexico 2-1, securing key win in quest for World Cup berth|author=Sandor, Steven|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=November 16, 2021|access-date=October 9, 2022}}</ref> Both sides continued to get stuck in and frustrations started to boil over near the end as Mexico desperately attempted to find equalizing goals. Mexico would eventually find the net in the ninetieth minute of play, when [[Hector Herrera]] was able to head in a cross from the right and half the deficit. This was quickly followed by a skirmish in front of goal as Mexican players attempted to swipe the ball from goalkeeper [[Milan Borjan]], whom had immediately pounced on the ball to [[Running out the clock|delay the restart]] as the match entered stoppage time. With increased motivation to equalize, Mexico unleashed several promising attacks throughout additional time, most notably in the third additional minute when the Canadian defense failed to clear away a cross and gave away a shot from two yards out. However, Borjan was able to make a goal line save, prompting several protests from Mexican players who believed the ball was over the line.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sportsnet.ca/soccer/article/snowbank-celly-following-canadas-win-mexico-party-starts-iceteca/|title='Snowbank Celly': Following Canada's win over Mexico, party starts at Iceteca|author=Morassutti, David|publisher=sportsnet.ca|date=November 17, 2021|access-date=October 9, 2022}}</ref> Canada attempted to kill the last couple seconds of the game by holding the ball in the corner, causing an angered [[Néstor Araujo]] to recklessly shoulder charge [[Lucas Cavallini]] from behind. The referee issued a yellow card for the challenge before ending the match.

Canada's three points from the match would cause them to surpass the United States and take first place, a position that they would maintain for the rest of the tournament. In Canada, this match was seen by many as a turning point for Canadian soccer and the men's national team, whose normal reputation of being an underdog team in international competition with little prestige or potential, were now being proclaimed as the 'Kings of CONCACAF.'<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theathletic.com/3688075/2021/11/17/canada-stuns-mexico-2-1-on-a-frigid-night-in-edmonton-in-concacaf-world-cup-qualifying/|title=Canada stuns Mexico 2-1 on a frigid night in Edmonton in CONCACAF World Cup qualifying|author=Kloke, Joshua|publisher=The Atlantic|date=November 16, 2021|access-date=October 26, 2022}}</ref> A staggering forty-four thousand fans turned up in sub-zero temperatures to watch the match, which in Edmonton was the national team's third highest attendance record, only sitting below the forty-eight thousand who showed for the match against Costa Rica four days earlier, and the fifty-two thousand people who attended a friendly against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in 1994. Canada would eventually qualify for the [[FIFA World Cup]] for the [[Canada at the FIFA World Cup|first time since 1986]]. Despite the loss, Mexico would eventually reach second place and qualify as well for the [[Mexico at the FIFA World Cup|seventeenth time in their history]].

===2022 World Cup===
Despite their successful qualifying campaign, Canada was only able to qualify for Pot 4 of the [[2022 FIFA World Cup#Draw|World Cup draw]], and were placed in a challenging group with [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] (the 2nd ranked country in the world), as well as [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] and [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]] who would both eventually reach the semi-finals. Mexico despite qualifying for Pot 2 were also matched with difficult opposition in [[Poland national football team|Poland]], the eventual World Cup champions [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], and [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]]. 

Canada were able to shock the world in their fourth ever World Cup match by putting up an incredible fight against Belgium, but were unable to find their first points at the World Cup due to a missed penalty-kick and poor finishing in an eventual 1–0 loss.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/23/belgium-canada-world-cup-group-f-match-report|title=Belgium run ragged by Canada but Michy Batshuayi strikes to grab victory|date=23 November 2022|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2 February 2023}}</ref> Despite being praised by the international press, and the Belgian coaching staff,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.skysports.com/football/news/12098/12753993/world-cup-2022-belgium-1-0-canada-michy-batshuayi-fires-red-devils-to-opening-win|title=World Cup 2022 – Belgium 1–0 Canada: Michy Batshuayi fires Red Devils to opening win|website=Sky Sports}}</ref> Canada would be defeated by Croatia and Morocco, and exited their second World Cup with two goals and no points.
