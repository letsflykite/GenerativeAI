==Style of play==
Known for his vision, athleticism and leadership, Gündoğan's manager, Pep Guardiola, described him as "one of the best players [he had] worked with".<ref>{{Cite web |title=Guardiola: Gündoğan one of the best I've worked with |url=https://www.mancity.com/news/mens/manchester-city-leeds-united-pep-guardiola-ilkay-gundogan-63819078}}</ref>

[[Jürgen Klopp]], Gündoğan's former coach at Borussia Dortmund, has described Gündoğan as an "intelligent and complete midfielder with numerous strengths".<ref name=wright>{{cite web |last=Wright |first=Nick |title=Ilkay Gundogan: We profile the Manchester United target |url=http://www1.skysports.com/football/news/21476/9821981/ilkay-gundogan-we-profile-the-midfielder-wanted-by-manchester-united |website=Sky Sports |access-date=27 April 2015}}</ref> Although Gündoğan had a tough start at Dortmund, where he admitted "things hadn't gone as well as I had thought", his "willingness to learn" and "great attitude", according to Klopp, allowed him to play a pivotal role in his later career at the club in the [[deep-lying playmaker]] role.<ref name=wright/> He was able to fit into Dortmund's "explosive" style "by combining creativity and outstanding passing with the defensive attributes and tireless energy needed".<ref name=wright/> In his earlier years, Gündoğan was often deployed as a [[wide midfielder]], but later established himself in a more central role at Dortmund. Regarding this positional switch, he commented: "I came to the conclusion that playing wide wasn't my strength. I feel fine playing as a [[Defensive midfielder|defensive]] or [[central midfielder]], but I also believe that I can hold my own as a [[playmaker]]."<ref name="UEFA Profile"/> In a 2016 [[UEFA]] profile, Philip Röber also noted that Gündoğan "excels in possession-based teams and can dictate a side's tempo."<ref name="UEFA Profile"/>

At Manchester City, Gündoğan was deployed in a variety of midfield positions, including in a holding role.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.mancity.com/news/first-team/first-team-news/2019/august/ilkay-gundogan-signs-new-man-city-contract |title=Gundogan extends City stay |publisher=Manchester City F.C. |last=Leigh |first=Neil |date=9 August 2019 |access-date=6 November 2019}}</ref><ref name="stats question">{{cite news |url=https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/sport/football/football-news/gundogan-foden-stats-man-city-17046357 |title=Revealing Ilkay Gundogan stats question why he is ahead of Phil Foden at Man City |newspaper=Manchester Evening News |last=Brennan |first=Stuart |date=8 October 2019 |access-date=6 November 2019}}</ref> Although he was not statistically as productive as his other midfield teammates, specifically in terms of the number of goals and assists, he drew praise in the media for his ability to circulate possession and create space for other players.<ref name="stats question"/> Throughout his career, Gündoğan often struggled with injuries.<ref name="MC-contract-2023"/><ref name="UEFA Profile">{{cite web |url=https://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=2367812.html |title=Manchester City signing İlkay Gündoğan in profile |first=Philip |last=Röber |publisher=UEFA |date=2 June 2016 |access-date=4 June 2023}}</ref>

In May 2018, Gündoğan met Turkish President [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] in London, along with [[Mesut Özil]] and [[Cenk Tosun]], two other England-based, German-born players of Turkish descent. Gündoğan was criticised for referring to Erdoğan as "my president", despite not being a citizen of Turkey. The incident caused political controversy in Germany, and Gündoğan was jeered by German fans when playing for the national team weeks later.<ref>{{cite news |title=Ilkay Gundogan, Mesut Ozil whistles must stop – Germany chief Oliver Bierhoff |url=http://www.espn.co.uk/football/germany/story/3520068/ilkay-gundogan-and-mesut-ozil-whistles-must-stop-germany-chief-oliver-bierhoff |access-date=4 June 2023 |publisher=ESPN |date=8 June 2018}}</ref>
