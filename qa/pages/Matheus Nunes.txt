During his time with the club, Nunes played mostly in the [[reserve team]], before moving to [[Primeira Liga]] side [[Sporting CP]] in January 2019. With Sporting, Nunes won a [[Primeira Liga]] title and back-to-back [[Taça da Liga|Taças da Liga]] in [[2020–21 Taça da Liga|2021]] and [[2021–22 Taça da Liga|2022]], while being part of the squad that won a [[Double (association football)|double]] in 2021, leading to him being named in the Primeira Liga Team of the Year in 2022. In August, Nunes signed with [[Premier League]] side Wolverhampton Wanderers for a club-record transfer worth €45 million (£38 million).
