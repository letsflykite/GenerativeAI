==Early life==
Born in [[Santo Domingo, Ecuador|Santo Domingo]], the youngest of ten siblings, Caicedo would play football on the scrubland pitches of his hometown, where goals were marked out by piles of stones.<ref name=athletic>{{cite web|url=https://theathletic.com/4670519/2023/07/07/moises-caicedo-brighton-chelsea-he-was-made-for-the-big-clubs/|title=Moises Caicedo’s rise and rise: ‘He was made for the big clubs’|first=Jack|last=Lang|date=7 July 2023|access-date=9 July 2023|website=theathletic.com|url-access=subscription}}</ref> As a child he met local football coach Ivan Guerra, who would help Caicedo and his family by paying for his football boots, travel and food.<ref name=athletic/>

==Club career==
===Early career===
Caicedo joined a local academy, named after the Ecuadorian side [[Barcelona S.C.|Barcelona]], having been invited by Guerra.<ref name=athletic/> The team would often play in games across the [[Santo Domingo Canton (Ecuador)|Santo Domingo Canton]], and Caicedo earned a call-up to a regional select XI.<ref name=athletic/> During his youth, he also played for local side Colorados Jaipadida.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://lacancha.com.ec/2023/05/13/moises-caicedo-y-oscar-zambrano-salieron-del-semillero-jaipadida/|title=Moisés Caicedo y Óscar Zambrano salieron del semillero Jaipadida|trans-title=Moisés Caicedo and Óscar Zambrano left the Jaipadida seedbed|first=Mauricio|last=Bayas|date=13 May 2023|access-date=9 July 2023|website=lacancha.com.ec|language=es}}</ref> Initially a [[Forward (association football)|forward]], Caicedo later developed into a midfielder, and joined the academy of professional side [[C.D. ESPOLI|ESPOLI]].<ref name=athletic/>

===Independiente del Valle===
At the age of thirteen, one of his brothers brought him to [[Ecuadorian Serie A]] side [[C.S.D. Independiente del Valle|Independiente del Valle]] for trials, which he successfully passed.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elcomercio.com/deportes/independiente-caicedo-juvenil-ramirez-sangolqui.html|title=Moisés Caicedo, la nueva 'joya' que formó el Independiente del Valle|trans-title=Moisés Caicedo, the new 'jewel' that formed Independiente del Valle|first=Martha|last=Córdova|date=23 February 2020|access-date=9 July 2023|website=elcomercio.com|language=es}}</ref> Having suffered a ruptured cruciate ligament in his knee in 2017, he required a number of surgeries, and was out for a total of ten months.<ref name=athletic/> He recovered from the injury, and following his arrival at the club to manager the under-18 side in 2019, manager Yuri Solano stated that Caicedo's athleticism "set him apart from the rest at that time".<ref name=athletic/>

Later in 2019, Caicedo captained the Independiente del Valle youth team to the Copa Mitad del Mundo title, a youth tournament in Spain.<ref name=athletic/> Following this experience, he made his debut for the Independiente del Valle first team in a 1–0 [[Ecuadorian Serie A]] win over [[L.D.U. Quito]] on 1 October of the same year.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ca.soccerway.com/matches/2019/10/01/ecuador/primera-a/independiente-jose-teran/liga-deportiva-universitaria-de-quito/2967188/|title=Independiente del Valle vs. LDU Quito - 1 October 2019 - Soccerway|website=ca.soccerway.com}}</ref> First team manager at the time, [[Miguel Ángel Ramírez]], would later say that "from the first day he trained with us, he was the best player in the squad".<ref name=athletic/>

Such was his importance to the first team squad, Ramirez would have Caicedo flown back from an [[U-20 Copa Libertadores]] game in Paraguay to feature in a Serie A match against rivals L.D.U. Quito in 2020 - a game which Independiente del Valle won 3–2 - before returning to the under-20 squad to play in the [[2020 U-20 Copa Libertadores]] final, where he shone in a win over Argentine opposition [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]].<ref name=athletic/>

Throughout his time at Independiente del Valle, Caicedo was mostly deployed as a "number 5", a more defensive midfielder, but would also play at [[Defender (association football)|centre-back]].<ref name=athletic/> Due to the form of Independiente's Argentine midfielder [[Cristian Pellerano]], who also occupied the defensive midfield spot, Caicedo was pushed higher up, operating as a box-to-box midfielder.<ref name=athletic/> His performances in this role drew acclaim across the continent, most notably after scoring in a 5–0 win against Brazilian side [[CR Flamengo|Flamengo]] in the 2020 edition of the [[Copa Libertadores]]; after stepping over a pass from [[Beder Caicedo]], a [[Dummy (football)|dummy]] which fooled a number of Flamengo defenders, he received the ball from a [[Gabriel Torres]] pass, before placing the ball past Flamengo goalkeeper [[César (footballer, born 1992)|César]].<ref name=athletic/>
