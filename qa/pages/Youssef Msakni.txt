==Club career==

===ES Tunis===
Having spent his youth career [[Stade Tunisien]], Msakni moved to [[Espérance Sportive de Tunis]] in July 2008.

He played his first game with ES Tunis on 26 July 2009, on the first day of the [[2009–10 Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 1|2009–10 season]], against [[Olympique Béja]]. He entered the field in the 79th minute of play in replacement of [[Henri Bienvenu Ntsama]]. Two weeks later, on 8 August, Msakni scored his first league goal in his third game against [[AS Kasserine]] in the 54th minute of play of a 4–0 win.

On 12 November 2011, he won the [[2011 CAF Champions League|CAF Champions League]], finishing second in the competition with five goals, just behind [[Wydad Casablanca]] striker [[Fabrice Ondama]], who scored six goals.

On 30 September 2012, he won the [[Tunisian Ligue Professionnelle 1]] for the fourth time, winning the title of best scorer in the Tunisian football championship with 17 goals. According to Goal.com, Msakni was the 48th best footballer of the 2012 season in all countries, thanks in particular to the performances realized under the colors of his club or the national team. During the transfer period, he was courted by many French clubs, including [[Paris Saint-Germain]], [[Lille OSC]], [[AS Monaco]] and [[FC Lorient]], but on 3 July 2012 the attacking midfielder signed on a four-year contract with Qatari Stars League club [[Lekhwiya SC]], but he joined the club on 1 January 2013.<ref>Mohamad Mosselhi (3 July 2012) [http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/6/54/46833/Sports/Africa/Tunisia-forward-Msakni-joins-Qatari-side-Lekhwiya.aspx Tunisia forward Msakni joins Qatar's Lekhwiya for Arab record sum]. Ahram Online</ref>

===Lekhwiya and Al Duhail===
On 1 January 2013, Msakni became a player of Qatari club Lekhwiya SC for a period of four and a half years; the total amount of the transfer was 23 million dinars (€11.5 million), a record for an African player.

On 10 February, he scored his first goal in the 28th minute, with his team winning 4–0 against [[Al-Wakrah SC]]. On 26 February, Msakni proved decisive in the [[2013 AFC Champions League|AFC Champions League]] with a free-kick in the 33rd minute, allowing his team to win 2–1. In March 2013, Msakni was reportedly coveted by four English clubs: [[Newcastle United]], [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] and [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.|Tottenham]]. This growing interest pushed the Qatari club leaders to review the player's release clause by increasing his price. On 4 May, he won the [[2013 Qatar Crown Prince Cup]] against the [[Al Sadd]] after scoring his team's third goal in a 3–2 win.

A complicated start to the 2013–14 season, during which he scored 7 goals in 12 league games, the Qatari media linked him with a departure to Ukrainian champions [[FC Shakhtar Donetsk|Shakhtar Donetsk]].

The start of the Asian campaign begins on 8 February 2014 for Msakni and his team-mates: they opposed the Bahraini team [[Hidd SCC]] in the second round of the [[2014 AFC Champions League]]; they won the match 2–1, including a decisive pass from the Tunisian striker. A week later, Lekhwiya SC competed in the third preliminary round of the same competition against Kuwaiti club [[Kuwait SC]], where two of his team-mates in [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]], [[Issam Jemâa]] and [[Chadi Hammami]] played. Msakni scored a goal and delivered two assists.

After the team changed its name from Lekhwiya to Al Duhail, he received offers from [[Olympique de Marseille]] and teams playing [[La Liga]] but he preferred to stay in Qatar and play in Europe after [[2018 FIFA World Cup]].

On 8 April 2018, it was reported that Msakni would miss this summer's World Cup in Russia after being ruled out for six months because of a knee injury.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/43683643|title=Youssef Msakni: Tunisia forward will miss World Cup because of knee injury|date=8 April 2018|work=BBC Sport|access-date=23 May 2018|language=en-GB}}</ref>
