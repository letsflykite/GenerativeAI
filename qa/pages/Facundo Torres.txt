==Club career==
===Peñarol===
Born in the [[Colón Centro y Noroeste|Colón]] neighborhood of  [[Montevideo]], Torres grew up in [[La Paz, Canelones]].<ref name="elobservador">{{cite web |title=Facu Torres, el zurdo al que felicitó el Pato Aguilera a los 10 años, lo quiso la Juve y al que Ghiggia le dio el trofeo de goleador |url=https://www.elobservador.com.uy/nota/torres-el-zurdo-al-que-felicito-aguilera-a-los-10-anos-lo-quiso-la-juve-y-lo-premio-ghiggia-202072020120 |website=El Observador}}</ref> At the age of four, Torres attended his first training session with his cousin Joaquín at Juventud River but showed little interest and instead sat in the middle of the field and played with dirt.<ref name="elobservador"/> His father later took him to La Paz Wanderers where he enjoyed playing with friends before spending a year with [[Defensor Sporting]]. At the age of 10 he was selected to play in the National Championship final to represent the regional southern league in [[Melo, Uruguay|Melo]] where he was scouted by [[Peñarol]] and invited to join their academy. With Peñarol, Torres traveled to Brazil to play in the {{ill|Encontro de Futebol Infantil Pan-americano|pt}}, a friendly international competition for academy teams. Despite being two years younger than his teammates such as [[Federico Valverde]], [[Diego Rossi]] and [[Santiago Bueno]], Torres was a standout player at the tournament.<ref name="elobservador"/> Coached by [[Robert Lima (footballer)|Robert Lima]], Torres continued to be fast-tracked through the age groups and in 2014, helped Peñarol to an under-15 national title.<ref>{{cite web |title=Formativas: los campeones premiados |url=https://www.tenfield.com.uy/formativas-los-campeones-premiados/ |website=Tenfield.com |language=es |date=25 February 2015}}</ref> In February 2016, he was invited to train with the professional senior team for the first time, at the age of 15. That same year, Italian [[Serie A]] club [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] made an attempt to sign Torres via his agent [[Daniel Fonseca]]. Torres' father opposed the move, thinking he was too young and describing it as "via the back door," parting ways with Fonseca as a result with Torres remaining at Peñarol to continue his development and earn playing time.<ref>{{cite web |title=Facu Torres, la historia del zurdo que eligió quedarse y sigue los pasos de Pellistri |url=https://www.elobservador.com.uy/nota/facu-torres-la-historia-del-zurdo-que-eligio-quedarse-y-sigue-los-pasos-de-pellistri-202141710490 |website=El Observador}}</ref>
