==International career==
Fati was originally eligible to represent [[Guinea-Bissau]] at international level, but did not represent the nation of his birth at any level.

Nevertheless, despite his robust physique, the La Masia graduate possesses outstanding [[Dribbling (association football)|dribbling]] skills which, when combined with his speed, makes him incredibly difficult to stop in one-on-one situations." It also highlighted his eye for goal and ability in the air, as well as his vision and ability to control play from midfield.<ref name="4-4-2"/> His perceived selfishness and decision-making were instead highlighted as weaknesses in his game.<ref name="4-4-2"/> Tor-Kristian Karlsen of ''[[ESPN]]'' described Fati as a "generational talent" in 2021, praising him for his speed, acceleration, ambidexterity, low centre of gravity, and technical skills, which make him difficult to dispossess, also noting his intelligence, movement, defensive work-rate, and link-up play as some of his main strengths.<ref name="saviours"/>
