==Style of play==
Allen is a hard-working, tactically disciplined and tenacious—albeit not overly physical—midfielder, who is capable of aiding his team both creatively and offensively courtesy of his ability to transition the ball from defence to attack effectively after winning back possession. A versatile and gifted player with a low centre of gravity and quick feet, he is capable of playing in several midfield roles. Due to his vision, composure in possession, efficient passing and ability to dictate the tempo of his team's play in midfield as a [[playmaker]], Allen has been described as the "Welsh [[Xavi]]" and as the "Welsh [[Andrea Pirlo|Pirlo]]" by his former manager at Swansea City and Liverpool, Brendan Rodgers.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/teams/liverpool/12083790/Joe-Allen-hailed-as-the-new-Andrea-Pirlo-after-genius-no-look-assist.html|title=Joe Allen hailed as the new Andrea Pirlo after 'genius' no-look assist |newspaper=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |first=Callum |last=Davis|date=5 January 2016|access-date=6 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/team/wales/578/blog/post/2884088/wales-give-joe-ledley-euro-2016-chance-while-gareth-bale-is-the-main-star|title=Wales give Joe Ledley Euro 2016 chance; Gareth Bale is the main star|publisher=ESPN FC |first=Glen |last=Wilson|date=1 June 2016|access-date=6 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2012/oct/09/alan-shearer-joe-allen|title=Alan Shearer's Joe Allen analysis misses point, says Brendan Rodgers |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |first=Andy |last=Hunter|date=9 October 2012|access-date=6 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.espnfc.us/club/liverpool/364/blog/post/2852771/liverpool-led-by-joe-allen-in-win-at-bournemouth|title=Liverpool beat Bournemouth 2–1 as Joe Allen runs the show in Reds' midfield|publisher=ESPN FC |first=David |last=Usher|date=17 April 2016|access-date=6 June 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-soccer-euro-wal-allen-idUKKCN0ZL0TI|title=Allen making a name for himself as a Wales hero|work=Reuters|first=Toby |last=Davis|date=5 July 2016|access-date=8 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/joe-allen-in-profile |title=Joe Allen in profile |publisher=Liverpool F.C. |first=Phil |last=Reade |date=10 August 2012 |access-date=8 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026181403/http://www.liverpoolfc.com/news/latest-news/joe-allen-in-profile |archive-date=26 October 2012 |url-status=dead}}</ref>
