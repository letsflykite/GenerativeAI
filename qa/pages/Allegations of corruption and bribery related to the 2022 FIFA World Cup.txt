In May 2011, allegations of corruption within the [[FIFA]] senior officials raised questions over the legitimacy of the World Cup being held in Qatar. According to then vice-president [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]], an email has been publicised about the possibility that Qatar 'bought' the 2022 World Cup through bribery via [[Mohammed bin Hammam]] who was president of the [[Asian Football Confederation]] at the time. Qatar's officials in the bid team for 2022 have denied any wrongdoing.<ref>{{cite news |date=30 May 2011 |title=Valcke denies 2022 'bought' claim |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/13592684.stm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110530112059/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/13592684.stm |archive-date=30 May 2011}}</ref> A whistleblower, revealed to be Phaedra Almajid, alleged that several African officials were paid $1.5m by Qatar.<ref>{{cite magazine |date=23 May 2011 |title=Sorry Soccer |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |page=16}}</ref> She later retracted her claims of bribery, stating she had fabricated them in order to exact revenge on the Qatari bid team for relieving her of her job with them.

In March 2014, it was alleged that a firm linked to Qatar's successful campaign paid committee member [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]] and his family almost $2&nbsp;million. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' reported that it understands that the U.S. [[FBI]] is investigating Warner and his alleged links to the Qatari bid.<ref>{{cite news |last=Watt |first=Holly |date=18 March 2014 |title=World Cup 2022 investigation: demands to strip Qatar of World Cup |work=The Telegraph |location=London |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup/10706977/World-Cup-2022-investigation-demands-to-strip-Qatar-of-2020-World-Cup.html |access-date=20 March 2014}}</ref>

On 1 June 2014, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' claimed to have obtained documents including e-mails, letters and bank transfers which allegedly proved that Bin Hammam had paid more than 5&nbsp;million US dollars to Football officials to support the Qatar bid. Bin Hamman and all those accused of accepting bribes denied the charges.<ref>{{cite web |author=Bond, David |date=6 January 2014 |title='£3m payments to officials' corruption claim |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/27652181 |access-date=1 June 2014 |work=BBC News}}</ref>

Later in June 2014, [[Qatar Airways]] CEO [[Akbar Al Baker]] gave an interview to German media in June 2014 stating that the allegations are being driven by envy and mistrust by parties who do not want the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] staged in Qatar, and that the country is not getting the respect it deserves over its efforts to hold the World Cup. He reiterated that the [[Qatari Emir]] strictly punishes and forbids instances of corruption and bribery with a [[zero-tolerance policy]].<ref>{{cite web |date=30 June 2014 |title=Terms of trade union are killing Lufthansa |url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/handel-dienstleister/qatar-airways-chef-al-baker-bedingungen-der-gewerkschaften-toeten-lufthansa/10125510.html |access-date=4 July 2014 |work=Handelsblatt}}</ref>

In the [[2015 FIFA corruption case]], Swiss officials, operating under information from the [[United States Department of Justice]], arrested many senior FIFA officials in Zürich, Switzerland and seized physical and electronic records from FIFA's main headquarters. The arrests continued in the United States, where several FIFA officers were arrested, and FIFA buildings were raided.

== FIFA ethics investigation report ==
In 2014, FIFA appointed Michael Garcia as its independent ethics investigator to look into bribery allegations against Russia and Qatar, the hosts for the 2018 and 2022 World Cup respectively. Garcia investigated all nine bids and eleven countries involved in the 2018 and 2022 bids and spoke to all persons connected to the bids and appealed for witnesses to come forward with evidence.<ref>{{Cite news |title=Qatar cleared but England criticised |language=en-GB |work=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/30031405 |access-date=2022-09-17}}</ref> At the end of investigation, Garcia submitted a 430-page report in September 2015. FIFA governing body then appointed a German judge Hans Joachim Eckert who reviewed and presented a 42-page summary of the report two months later. The report cleared Qatar and Russia of bribery allegations stating that Qatar "pulled [[Aspire Academy|Aspire]] into the orbit of the bid in significant ways" but did not "compromise the integrity" of the overall bid process.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news |title=Fifa corruption report - what now? |language=en-GB |work=BBC Sport |url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/30042309 |access-date=2022-09-17}}</ref>

Michael Garcia reacted almost immediately stating that the report is “materially incomplete” and with “erroneous representations of the facts and conclusions".<ref name=":0" /> In 2017, a German journalist Peter Rossberg who claimed to have obtained the report wrote in a Facebook post that the report "does not provide the proof that the 2018 or 2022 World Cup was bought" and stated that he would publish the full report bit by bit. This forced FIFA to release the original report as authored by the investigator Michael Garcia. The full report did not provide any evidence of corruption against the host of 2022 World Cup but stated that bidders tested rules of conduct to the limit.<ref>{{Cite web |last1=Associated Press |date=2017-06-28 |others=The Associated Press is an independent not-for-profit news cooperative headquartered in New York City |title=FIFA releases report detailing alleged corruption in World Cup bids of Russia and Qatar |url=https://www.latimes.com/sports/soccer/la-sp-fifa-garcia-report-20170627-story.html |access-date=2022-09-17 |website=Los Angeles Times |language=en-US}}</ref> The report ended talks of a re-vote.

== 2020 ==
In January, [[Bonita Mersiades]], a whistle-blower from inside Australia's 2022 World Cup bid published a book which alleges that in the months before the vote in December 2010, FIFA executives were privately worried that a Qatar win would leave a financial shortfall for the governing body in 2022 which [[Al Jazeera]] (now beIN Sports) agreed a secret deal to pay $100&nbsp;million if Qatar won the vote. According to the book, the deal took place with the involvement and knowledge of [[Jérôme Valcke]], secretary general of FIFA at the time who was later banned for nine years from football for corruption. ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' asked [[beIN Sports]] about the allegations, in which a spokesman characterised the bonus as "production contributions" which were "standard market practice and are often imposed upon broadcasters by sports federations and sports rights holders".<ref name="TG">{{cite news |last=Ingle |first=Sean |date=10 March 2019 |title=Fifa facing urgent calls to investigate Qatar World Cup bid claims |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/football/2019/mar/10/qatar-fifa-world-cup-2022-damian-collins |access-date=24 November 2022}}</ref>

According to leaked documents obtained by ''The Sunday Times'', Qatari state-run television channel Al Jazeera secretly offered $400&nbsp;million to FIFA, for broadcasting rights, just 21 days before FIFA announced that Qatar will hold the 2022 World Cup. The contract also documented a secret TV deal between FIFA and Qatar's state run media broadcast Al Jazeera that $100&nbsp;million will also be paid into a designated FIFA account only if Qatar wins the World Cup ballot in 2010. An additional $480&nbsp;million was also offered by the State of Qatar government, three years after the initial offer, which brings the amount to $880&nbsp;million offered by Qatar to host the 2022 World Cup. The documents are now part of the bribery inquiry by Swiss Police.<ref name="JP">{{cite news |date=10 March 2019 |title=QATAR OFFERED FIFA $880 MILLION FOR HOSTING THE 2022 WORLD CUP - REPORT |work=The Jerusalem Post |url=https://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Qatar-offered-FIFA-880-million-for-hosting-the-2022-World-Cup-582998}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |date=10 March 2019 |title=Exclusive investigation: Qatar's secret $880m World Cup payments to Fifa |work=The Sunday Times |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/revealed-qatars-secret-880m-world-cup-payments-to-fifa-p3r5rvw9x}}</ref>

FIFA refused to comment on the inquiry and responded to ''The Sunday Times'' in an email and wrote "allegations linked to the FIFA World Cup 2022 bid have already been extensively commented by FIFA, who in June 2017 published the Garcia report in full on Fifa.com. Furthermore, please note that Fifa lodged a criminal complaint with the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland, which is still pending. FIFA is and will continue to cooperate with the authorities."<ref name="TG" /><ref name="JP" /> A beIN spokesman said in a statement that the company would not "respond to unsubstantiated or wildly speculative allegations."<ref name="TN">{{cite news |date=10 March 2019 |title=Qatar promised Fifa $100m if it won World Cup hosting rights |work=The National |url=https://www.thenational.ae/world/europe/qatar-promised-fifa-100m-if-it-won-world-cup-hosting-rights-1.835413}}</ref>

[[Damian Collins]], a British [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Member of Parliament]] (MP) and chairman of a UK parliamentary committee, called for payments from Al Jazeera to be frozen and launched an investigation into the apparent contract since the contract "appears to be in clear breach of the rules".<ref name="TG" />

Former UEFA president [[Michel Platini]] was arrested by French police on 18 June 2019 in relation to the rewarding of the 2022 World Cup to Qatar.
