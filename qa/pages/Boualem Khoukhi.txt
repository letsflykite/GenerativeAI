'''Boualem Khoukhi''' ({{lang-ar|بوعلام خوخي}}; born 9 July 1990) is a professional [[association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Defender (association football)|centre-back]] for [[Al-Sadd SC|Al Sadd]] in the [[Qatar Stars League]]. Born in Algeria, he is naturalized to represent the [[Qatar national football team|Qatar national team]].

==Club career==

===Youth career===
A pure product of the [[JSM Chéraga]] junior ranks, Khoukhi made his debut for the senior team in the 2009–10 season.<ref name="lebuteur1">{{cite web|url=http://www.lebuteur.com/en/actualites/khoukhi-courtise-par-la-selection-nationale-du-qatar|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322193055/http://www.lebuteur.com/en/actualites/khoukhi-courtise-par-la-selection-nationale-du-qatar|url-status=dead|archive-date=22 March 2010|title=Khoukhi : courtisé par la sélection nationale du Qatar|publisher=lebuteur.com|access-date=26 January 2014}}</ref> He struggled in his first season, but his career was soon revived when [[Farid Zemiti]] was hired as the head coach of the club. He became integrated into the first team, playing alongside future Algeria international [[Islam Slimani]], and many Algerian clubs were alleged to be interested in the services of Khoukhi, including [[USM El Harrach]].

He soon received an offer from [[Al-Shamal Sports Club|Al Shamal]] in Qatar, which he accepted. However, after landing in Qatar, Al Arabi head coach [[Uli Stielike]] believed Khoukhi had exceptional potential and offered him a trial at the club. He accepted the trial and was offered a contract deal shortly after.<ref name="lebuteur1" />

===Al Arabi (2009–2017)===
Khoukhi soon earned a starting spot in [[Al-Arabi SC (Qatar)|Al Arabi]]'s first team after his initial arrival in November 2009.

On 5 September 2010, he started for Al Arabi in the final of the [[2010 Sheikh Jassem Cup]] against [[Lekhwiya]], with Al Arabi winning 1–0.<ref>[http://www.alarab.com.qa/details.php?docId=147618&issueNo=994&secId=20 رأس «كابوري» تمنح العربي كأس الشيخ جاسم] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110903151756/http://www.alarab.com.qa/details.php?docId=147618&issueNo=994&secId=20 |date=3 September 2011 }}</ref>

He received a loan offer from Saudi club [[Ittihad FC|Al Ittihad]] on 10 January 2014 after his performances in the WAFF Championship. He also received a transfer offer from Japanese side [[Júbilo Iwata]], a club coached by former Al Arabi coach [[Péricles Chamusca]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdn.alkass.net/news_details.aspx?news_id=63899|title=اتحاد جدة يطلب ضم بوعلام من العربي|publisher=alkass.net|access-date=10 January 2014|date=10 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111023445/http://cdn.alkass.net/news_details.aspx?news_id=63899|archive-date=11 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> These offers came after reports that Khoukhi was planning to leave Al Arabi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cdn.alkass.net/news_details.aspx?news_id=63908|title=بوعلام: العربي بيتي وهناك "أشخاص" يشوّهون صورتي|publisher=alkass.net|access-date=10 January 2014|date=10 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140111023324/http://cdn.alkass.net/news_details.aspx?news_id=63908|archive-date=11 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> Shortly after allegations of planning to move to another club, he silenced the rumors by signing a contract renewal with Al Arabi.

===Al Sadd (2017–present)===
In July 2017, Khoukhi joined [[Al-Sadd SC|Al Sadd]]. In July 2019, [[Al-Gharafa SC|Al-Gharafa]] announced signing him on a four-year deal but Al Sadd denied the transfer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.qatar-tribune.com/news-details/id/169139|title=Khoukhi joins Al Sadd camp in Spain amid transfer scuffle|website=Qatar Tribune|date=29 July 2019}}</ref>

==International career==

===Algeria===
Khoukhi was born and raised in Algeria. On 9 November 2010, Khoukhi was called up for the first time to the [[Algeria Olympic football team|Algeria under–23 national team]] for a pair of friendlies against [[Tunisia]].<ref>[http://www.dzfoot.com/news-7758/en-u23-la-liste-pour-le-stage-en-tunisie/ La liste pour le stage en Tunisie]</ref> The [[Qatar Football Association]] attempted to naturalize Khoukhi shortly after he arrived in Qatar, however, he refused and said that he would not be naturalized for any amount of money. He stated his desire was to play with the Algeria senior national team.<ref name="lebuteur1" /> Subsequently, he received Qatari citizenship in order to assist in his club's foreign player quota.

===Qatar===
Despite his call up to Algeria's Olympic team, he was called up to the [[Qatar national football team|Qatar B team]] on 13 November 2013 by compatriot [[Djamel Belmadi]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://en.dzfoot.com/2013/11/qatar-calls-up-algerian-duo-of-boualem-khoukhi-and-karim-boudiaf/|title=Qatar calls up Algerian duo of Boualem Khoukhi and Karim Boudiaf|publisher=dzfoot.com|date=13 November 2013|access-date=30 December 2013|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230233723/http://en.dzfoot.com/2013/11/qatar-calls-up-algerian-duo-of-boualem-khoukhi-and-karim-boudiaf/|archive-date=30 December 2013}}</ref> When questioned about Khoukhi's call-up to the squad, Belmadi said that Khoukhi was naturalized prior to his call-up in order for his team, Al Arabi, to overcome the foreign player quota.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lebuteur.com/actualite-flash/belmadi-boudiaf-et-khoukhi-etaient-naturalises-et|title=Belmadi : "Boudiaf et Khoukhi étaient naturalisés et..."|publisher=lebuteur|language=fr|access-date=1 January 2014|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102200810/http://www.lebuteur.com/actualite-flash/belmadi-boudiaf-et-khoukhi-etaient-naturalises-et|archive-date=2 January 2014}}</ref> Belmadi stated he was surprised when the [[Qatar Football Association|QFA]] revealed Khoukhi was eligible to be called up to the Qatar national team. He made his official debut for the team on 25 December in the 2014 WAFF Championship in a 1–0 win against [[Palestine national football team|Palestine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.the-waff.com/assets/reports/391_match.pdf|title=Match report|publisher=the-waff.com|access-date=30 December 2013}}</ref>

In the next match on 31 December 2013 against Saudi Arabia, who were fielding their Olympic squad, Khoukhi scored a brace and attained an assist to give his team a 4–1 win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dohastadiumplusqatar.com/adel-khoukhi-star-qatars-big-win/|title=Adel, Khoukhi help Qatar progress|publisher=dohastadiumplusqatar.com|access-date=1 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140102200311/http://www.dohastadiumplusqatar.com/adel-khoukhi-star-qatars-big-win/#|archive-date=2 January 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref> On 4 January 2014, Khoukhi helped Qatar, once again, netting a brace against [[Kuwait national football team|Kuwait]] to send Qatar to the finals.

In the final of the [[2014 WAFF Championship]], Khoukhi scored another brace defeating Jordan 2–0. This would bring his final goal tally to six thus becoming the tournament's top goalscorer and being lauded by the [[Qatar Football Association]] as one of the key-men to Qatar's [[2015 AFC Asian Cup]] campaign in the future.<ref name="facebook.com">https://www.facebook.com/theafcasiancup/posts/624246230956452:0?stream_ref=1 {{User-generated source|certain=yes|date=March 2022}}</ref>

In their opening match of [[2019 Copa America]] Khouki scored in Qatar's 2–2 draw with Paraguay.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.euronews.com/2019/06/16/qatar-shake-up-copa-with-thrilling-comeback-against-paraguay|title=Qatar shake up Copa with thrilling comeback against Paraguay |work=Euronews |date=16 June 2019 |access-date=17 June 2019}}</ref>
