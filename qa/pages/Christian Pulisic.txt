==Club career==
After the family returned to the Hershey area, Pulisic grew up playing for local [[U.S. Soccer Development Academy]] club PA Classics and occasionally training with local professional club Harrisburg City Islanders, now known as [[Penn FC]], during his teen years.

Pulisic moved to Germany before his 16th birthday. He became eligible on the premise that his grandfather was Croatian, therefore he could get a European passport and play starting at age 16 rather than 18. He initially had issues getting the passport, but it eventually panned out.<ref name=":5">{{Cite web |date=2022-11-16 |title=How Christian Pulisic became American soccer's reticent and resilient trailblazer |url=https://sports.yahoo.com/how-christian-pulisic-became-american-soccers-reticent-and-resilient-trailblazer-181052557.html |access-date=2022-11-16 |website=sports.yahoo.com |language=en-US |archive-date=November 16, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221116075055/https://sports.yahoo.com/how-christian-pulisic-became-american-soccers-reticent-and-resilient-trailblazer-181052557.html |url-status=live }}</ref>
