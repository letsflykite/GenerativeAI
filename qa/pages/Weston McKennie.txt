== Style of play ==
McKennie is known for his versatility as a player. During his time at Schalke, McKennie played in numerous positions including in midfield, as a center-back, full-back, and even as a [[Forward (association football)#Striker|striker]].<ref>{{Cite web|title=What is Weston McKennie's best position for Schalke and the USA?|url=https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/what-is-weston-mckennie-s-best-position-for-schalke-and-the-usa-usmnt-40|access-date=August 29, 2020|website=bundesliga.com - the official Bundesliga website|language=en}}</ref> However, he has primarily played as either a box-to-box midfielder or in a deeper-lying defensive role.<ref name=":2">{{Cite web|date=January 10, 2019|title=Tactical Analysis: Weston McKennie, Schalke's jack-of-all-trades|url=https://totalfootballanalysis.com/player-analysis/weston-mckennie-schalke-tactical-analysis-statistics|access-date=August 29, 2020|website=Total Football Analysis Magazine|language=en-GB}}</ref> During his time with Juventus, he has been used in several midfield positions, including as a [[Midfielder#Wide midfielder|wide midfielder]], in a [[Midfielder#Defensive midfielder|holding role]], or even as a more [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|offensive-minded]] [[Midfielder#Central midfielder|central midfielder]], known as the ''[[Midfielder#Mezzala|mezzala]]'' role in Italian soccer jargon.<ref name="maghetto">{{cite news |url=https://www.ilmessaggero.it/sport/calcio/juve_mckennie_e_un_maghetto_per_pirlo-5743523.html |title=La Juve e McKennie, c'è un maghetto per Pirlo |trans-title=Juve and McKennie, there's a little wizard for Pirlo |work=Il Messaggero |language=it |last1=Mauro |first1=Alberto |date=February 4, 2021 |access-date=May 20, 2021 }}</ref>

McKennie's primary attributes are his defensive skills and work rate, as well as his ability to win back the ball.<ref name=":2"/> Furthermore, his passing allows him to dictate the flow of the game and push the ball forward from [[Midfielder#Deep-lying playmaker (Strolling 10)|deep-lying positions in midfield]].<ref>{{Cite web|date=November 6, 2017|title=Scout Report: Weston McKennie {{!}} Schalke's American stalwart|url=http://outsideoftheboot.com/2017/11/07/scout-report-weston-mckennie-schalkes-american-stalwart/|access-date=August 29, 2020|website=Outside of the Boot|language=en-US}}</ref> His ball-winning qualities, combined with his positioning, tactical intelligence, eye for goal from midfield, and ability to make late attacking runs into the box led Alberto Mauro of ''[[Il Messaggero]]'' to compare him to former Juventus midfielders [[Edgar Davids]] and [[Arturo Vidal]]; McKennie's technical ability was cited as an area in need of improvement, however.<ref name="maghetto"/>
